        <p> Full Text: Why America should worry about the shrinking number of listed firms LAST month Schumpeter attended an event at the New York Stock Exchange held in honour of Brian Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, a room-sharing website that private investors value at $31bn.
 A smaller number of older, bigger firms dominate bourses.
 The average listed firm has a lifespan of 18 years, up from 12 years two decades ago, and is worth four times more.
 Consider the first reason behind the slump in the number of listed firms: the IPO drought.
 Many big, mainstream fund managers, such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, are investing in unicorns, meaning private firms that are worth over $1bn, of which there are now roughly 100.
 At its fund-raising round last autumn, employees were able to sell around $200m of shares, which does away with another reason for firms to do an IPO. Exits from the stockmarket by established firms-the second factor behind listed firms' shrinking ranks-are growing in number.
 Some firms get bought by private-equity funds but most get taken over by other corporations, usually listed ones.
 Perhaps the number of listed firms will stop falling.
 Continued decline in the number of listed firms would be bad news.
 Fewer listed firms also undermines the notion of shareholder democracy.

        <p> Full Text: Investors don't always like democracy THE VICTORY of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, in a referendum on April 16th is seen by many observers as a worrying step on the road to autocracy.
 Like an errant husband, investors may proclaim their fidelity to democracy but are not averse to seeing someone else on the side.
 In Turkey investors may have feared turmoil if Mr Erdogan's proposal had been defeated.
 The early years of Mr Erdogan's tenure, when he was seen as a liberalising democrat, saw rapid economic growth; his transformation into an emerging autocrat has not put investors off.
 Go back in time 100 years and investors would have been pretty suspicious of democratic governments.
 Democracies can enact policies that are not market-friendly; the interests of ordinary voters and international investors are not always aligned.
 In many countries, investors could be relatively relaxed about which party took office; economic reforms were pushed through by Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schroder and Tony Blair, all politicians from the centre-left.
 Democracies work best when there is a modicum of consensus and voters are willing to accept defeat for their own side as legitimate.
 The general drift is towards more authoritarian, more nationalistic policies that appeal to voters whose living standards have stagnated.
 Investors may believe that some of these authoritarian leaders will deliver policies they like in the short run-tax cuts, for example.

        <p> Full Text: The new generation of Tory MPs will not cause the prime minister much grief WITH the Conservatives far ahead in the polls, Theresa May's parliamentary party is likely to swell after the election.
 If the polls pan out, around 100 new Conservative MPs might soon be taking the oath of allegiance to the Crown.
 In places like the Labour marginal of Brentford and Isleworth in south-west London local Conservatives say they consider a candidate's support for "Social justice" to be as important as anything else.
 The tight timetable should help Mrs May to choose sympathetic candidates.
 Normally, local Conservative associations spend months carefully choosing their parliamentary candidate.
 Activists tend to be to the right of the parliamentary party, and most would dearly love to choose hard-Brexit candidates.
 Garry Heath, a member of the Wycombe Conservative Association, wrote on the ConservativeHome blog that the Tories should "Purge our party and deselect the Remainers".
 Conservative Central Office is expected to step in and present local associations with a shortlist of candidates.
 These lists will reflect Mrs May's politics; in turn, the candidates will be loyal to her if elected.
 The easiest option in many cases will be simply to reselect the candidate who stood in the 2015 election.

        <p> Full Text: An all-American product finds new takers EARLY spring is the main selling season for recreational vehicles and the phone on Tom Troiano's desk has been ringing incessantly.
 The owner of Continental RV, a dealership in Farmingdale, a village on Long Island, Mr Troiano is on track to sell more RVs this year than in any other since the early 2000s.
 RVs are a quintessentially American invention: more than two-thirds are made in the United States.
 Nationally, sales surged to 430,000 units last year, a 40-year high.
 During the 2008-09 recession, notes Mr Troiano, RV dealerships everywhere closed down, leaving his shop among the very few left serving the New York metropolitan area.
 A decade ago the average age of an RV-owner was 49, and over 90% were white, says Kevin Broom of the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, an industry body.
 Anecdotal reports suggest that ethnic minorities now make up around a sixth of all new customers, says Mr Broom.
 The industry hopes that its poor record with foreign sales-last year less than 1% of RVs produced domestically were shipped to foreign markets-may improve, too.
 The country imported 1,000 vehicles last year, over half of them American.
 RV manufacturers are also marketing the notion that their motor homes can be commercial as well as leisure vehicles.

        <p> They first crossed the vast North American continent, and when they ran out of land, Manifest Destiny took to the sea, unrolling an expanding American frontier across the Pacific.
 American traders set off by sea, accompanied by missionaries, guano miners, planters and expeditionary forces.
 Hawaii, with its superb port, Pearl Harbour, was the first Pacific territory to come under American sway; the kingdom was eventually annexed in 1898.
 After an easy victory over the Spanish in Manila, the Americans found themselves fighting a counter-insurgency against Filipinos seeking their own republic.
 The generals in the Philippine campaign had nearly all earned their spurs fighting native Americans.
 In three years of fighting, between 200,000 and 700,000 men, women and children died as a consequence of American brutality.
 In the southern Philippines, American troops were fighting Muslim insurgents long after the rest of the archipelago had been pacified-and American special forces are still in Mindanao today.
 The American violence, and decades of condescending racism that followed, go some way towards explaining a vein of anti-Americanism that resurfaces from time to time in a country that also admires America.
 Most Americans are blithely unaware of the back story, viewing Mr Duterte's behaviour as astonishing ingratitude towards an ally that, until Philippine independence in 1946, had tried to pour its protege's society into an American mould, and that had remained a close friend since.
 One lesson is that the case for a continued American presence in Asia has to be constantly remade.

        <p> Mrs May says the election is necessary to protect the Brexit process from mischievous opposition parties that plan to derail it.
 Elections are inherently hard to predict-this one could be treated by voters as a poll about everything from the railways to the National Health Service.
 With Mr Corbyn clinging on and the economy yet to feel the smack of Brexit, Mrs May has a chance to increase her working majority of 17 to perhaps more than 100.
 For the 48% of voters who, like this newspaper, opposed Brexit, this may look ominous.
 Although Mrs May has sometimes threatened to leave without any agreement, saying "No deal is better than a bad deal", she has lately accepted the need for a transition arrangement after Brexit.
 In Parliament the election will end the odd situation in which MPs have been bound both by the wishes of their constituents in the previous election and also by the referendum.
 The next parliament's MPs will have a mandate to stand up for whatever they advocate on the stump, be it hard Brexit, soft Brexit or complete Breversal.
 Tories fighting seats in Remain-voting areas such as London and the university towns may have to soften their line on Brexit if they are to avoid a similar fate.
 Since the referendum those advocating a soft Brexit have been shouted down as anti-democratic.
 Businesses, lobby groups and, of course, private citizens have a chance to make the case for a soft Brexit both during the campaign and after it, during the long months of negotiation to follow.

        <p> Regulators added to the misery: last April the Fed rejected the "Living wills"-plans for liquidating lenders that get into trouble-of five of the six largest banks.
 Donald Trump's election in November, accompanied by promises to ginger up the American economy, cut corporate taxes and roll back regulation of finance, gave banks' shares a lift.
 "Wall Street activities have performed better than Main Street ones," says Mike Mayo, an independent bank analyst.
 Morgan Stanley, the last big bank to report, was arguably the star turn.
 Bank loans grew in the first quarter by just 0.7% at an annualised rate, according to the Fed, the slowest for almost six years.
 Widening interest margins helped some banks, as loan rates went up faster than funding costs: Bank of America's spread rose by 18 basis points from the previous quarter and JPMorgan Chase's by ten.
 In such a quarter Wells Fargo, the least dependent of the big six on investment banking, was perhaps the least likely to shine.
 Institutional Shareholder Services, a firm which advises investors, has recommended voting to replace most of Wells's board at the annual meeting on April 25th. Wells's woes notwithstanding, banks ought to be able to look ahead in good heart.
 In recent weeks, of the rally in banks' shares.
 Bankers have argued that it is high time red tape was cut: lending, they say, is being held back.

        <p> Last year no party campaigned to remain in the European Union so vehemently.
 The party's noisy opposition to the government's proposed "Hard Brexit" has helped it to notch up some spectacular swings in council and parliamentary elections since the referendum.
 Lib Dem watchers guess the party could pick up more than 20 new seats.
 Nick Clegg, a former party leader and deputy prime minister, has confirmed he will stand again.
 The party's position on Brexit has also helped it to win back protest voters, who abandoned the party when it got into bed with the Conservatives in 2010.
 According to a recent poll by Opinium, only a third of voters now think that the party was wrong to have entered into coalition with the Tories.
 Its appeal seems to go beyond Europhiles: since the referendum the party has picked up more council seats in Leave-voting areas than Remain ones.
 The party's profile will rise during the campaign; the fact that it is the most strident anti-Brexit party will attract television cameras, says Mr Ford.
 Even if the party's national polling does not pick up, it will pour resources into marginal seats, while other parties will have to campaign across the country.
 The party claims that its membership has doubled since the 2015 general election, to more than 90,000.

        <p> Full Text: America is gearing up for another debate over network neutrality THE details around network neutrality, the principle that internet-service providers must treat all sorts of web traffic equally, can be mind-numbingly abstruse.
 In the coming days Mr Pai is expected to unveil a proposal for new rules on net neutrality.
 Because of the protests in 2014 and because of a court decision that year suggesting that the FCC needed the jurisdiction to be able to mandate net-neutrality rules, Mr Wheeler reclassified internet access as a "Telecommunications service" to be under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning that ISPs are regulated as utilities.
 Mr Pai does support general rules to protect net neutrality.
 Once ISPs are no longer classed as telecommunications services he wants them to commit to net neutrality in their terms of service.
 The ISPs' commitments would, at bottom, be voluntary, as critics such as Chris Lewis of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group, note.
 ISPs could refuse to make promises on net neutrality, or abandon them down the line.
 Mr Pai may risk going too far even for his own comfort on net neutrality.
 The logical answer to this legal conundrum would be for Congress to add a statute on net neutrality to the Telecommunications Act, which predates the rise of the internet.
 Such a compromise would also be in tune with how the debate about net neutrality has evolved.

        <p> Full Text: After seven decades of hegemony in Asia, America now has to accommodate an increasingly powerful China, says Dominic Ziegler.
 For three-quarters of a century, America has been the hegemon in East Asia, China's historical backyard.
 China is the world's biggest trading nation and its second-biggest economy after America.
 In the past few years China has challenged Japan over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, and carried out extensive construction works to build bases and runways on disputed rocks and reefs in the South China Sea.
 Soon after his election Mr Trump even seemed to be calling into question America's endorsement of the "One-China policy"-China's insistence on the polite fiction that Taiwan is part of China.
 North Korea exasperates China's leaders, yet they feel they must show solidarity to a former ally against America in the bloody war North Korea launched in 1950.
 Conflict between China and America is not inevitable.
 America, for its part, has never had any experience of ceding as much influence and authority as it may have to do to China in future.
 Such people do not have a monopoly on the internal debate about America's strategic relationship with China, any more than they do on trade.
 The defence secretary, on his first trip to Asia in early February urged care when challenging Chinese construction in the South China Sea with military force, and emphasised the primacy of diplomacy over military action in resolving differences.

        <p> As the bloodsucker feeds on a human, in some parts of the world there is the chance it will transmit the larvae of worms which cause a disease called lymphatic filariasis.
 Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, guinea-worm disease, leishmaniasis, river blindness, trachoma and yaws are some of the 18 now collectively referred to as "Neglected tropical diseases".
 The resulting disabilities keep sufferers mired in poverty; that poverty is also what allows the diseases to thrive.
 David Molyneux, a parasitologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has been working on tropical diseases since 1965.
 The first human trial of ivermectin for river blindness was in Senegal in 1981, in patients who had the early stages of the disease but no damage to their eyes.
 Together with several more trials, it showed that ivermectin was safe in humans and highly effective at killing the disease vector in its larval state.
 Prevalences had to be mapped, and, for some of the diseases, individual patients diagnosed.
 In an article in 2004 in the Lancet, a medical journal, Dr Molyneux argued that these diseases were unfairly neglected in comparison with tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS, which were the subject of well-funded global programmes.
 Experience in a range of countries showed that these diseases could be controlled, he reminded his readers-and doing so brought dividends besides the relief of great suffering.
 Each dollar spent on the control of lymphatic filariasis in China, or Chagas disease in Brazil, has been estimated to produce benefits of $15 and $17 respectively, by reducing spending on treatment and cutting the number of prematurely curtailed working lives.

        <p> Less than a year after a watered-down version of the bill was finally forced through the assembly, Mr Macron launched En Marche! in his home town of Amiens, in the Somme region of northern France.
 Fully half of them say they could vote for Mr Melenchon, Ms Le Pen, or one of the minor fringe candidates-a cause of deep concern for other European countries, since both Mr Melenchon and Ms Le Pen want, in effect, to break up the EU. Ms Le Pen, Mr Macron, Mr Fillon and Mr Melenchon all have a shot at getting through Sunday's first round.
 Mr Macron, if he makes it through, appears a strong favourite; whoever she meets in the second round, Ms Le Pen looks highly likely to lose.
 "It's the first time that a candidate is offering something different, something positive," says a retired tax inspector at a Macron rally in Angers, a cathedral town in western France.
 While Mr Macron is trying to mobilise the France that still waves Europe's flag at rallies, two other candidates are harnessing the howl of rage against it, and the political establishment more generally.
 On Syrian refugees Mr Melenchon and Mr Macron stand together, urging France to be more welcoming; Mr Fillon and Ms Le Pen would keep the door shut.
 The only two candidates with no position in common are Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen.
 Generation Libre, a liberal think-tank, gives Mr Fillon and Mr Macron a 60% "Liberal" rating: all the other candidates get less than 34%. Mr Macron and Mr Fillon agree on a basic premise: that, over the past ten years, France has lost economic ground to Germany that it must regain.
 Mr Macron would keep it as it is and concentrate on a longer term but, he claims, deeper reform which the Fillon team sees as unrealistic: unifying France's anemone-like pension system, made up of 35 different public regimes, into a single structure with universal transparent rules.
 In France Mr Melenchon and Ms Le Pen have been the preferred candidates of the under 25s, though polls now show Ms Le Pen losing ground and Mr Macron rising fast.

        <p> Full Text: Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a Russian poet, died on April 1st, aged 83 BABI YAR was the site of the most notorious massacre of the Holocaust.
 He hurried away and wrote a poem, decrying not only the Nazi executioners but also Soviet anti-Semitism and the amnesia it fostered.
 Nikita Khrushchev's thaw was breaking over the Soviet Union, and the previously unsayable was being said.
 Shamefaced Soviet Ukrainian bureaucrats closed the tip and put up a modest memorial.
 His poetry books sold in their millions, a privilege few Russian poets enjoyed.
 Even his critic Joseph Brodsky, a great Russian poet forced into exile, said he knew hundreds of Mr Yevtushenko's lines by heart.
 Performance poet Charming, inquisitive and quick-tongued, he seemed a world away from the grey, stolid Soviet cultural establishment.
 Its content reflected the lively, even troublesome, spirit of the post-Stalinist 1950s and 1960s, but even that could be tolerated, within limits, especially as that toleration proved that the Soviet system was not as monolithic as its critics claimed.
 He bemoaned the Soviet system's imperfections while mounting rose-tinted defences of its achievements and wince-making attacks on the West.
 Post-Soviet Russia lost its taste for performance poetry.

        <p> Even before all of the ballots had been counted, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, stepped in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul and proclaimed victory.
 "April 16th was a victory for all of Turkey." Yet it was hardly the win Mr Erdogan had expected.
 After fresh elections in 2019, Mr Erdogan will rule uncontested, appointing senior officials, judges and members of his own cabinet, with little oversight by an expanded but weakened parliament.
 Mr Erdogan asked foreign observers to keep their concerns to themselves.
 His prime minister added: "The people's decision is clear and the result is a Yes." The allegations will haunt Mr Erdogan for years, leaving the country even more polarised than before.
 Mr Erdogan might be "The most unassailable Turkish leader since Ataturk but this legitimacy issue will hang over his head," says Soner Cagaptay, a fellow at the Washington Institute.
 Other than Donald Trump's America, which joined model democracies such as Russia, Sudan, Hungary and Djibouti in congratulating Mr Erdogan, no leader of a big Western country has welcomed the vote.
 Mr Erdogan did not appear particularly keen to rebuild bridges with Europe: on the day of the vote, he pledged once again to do his part to reinstate the death penalty, which would threaten the membership of Turkey in the Council of Europe and torpedo its already comatose accession talks with the EU. One-man show Supporters of the new constitution say it will improve decision-making by concentrating power in Mr Erdogan's hands, precluding unwieldy political coalitions and neutralising powerful unelected officials.
 Mr Erdogan is expected formally to rejoin AK as soon as official results are announced this week.
 Mr Erdogan's initial comments suggest he will disregard the slim margin of victory and portray the referendum as a sign of support for his crackdown.

        <p> Full Text: The authorities are flailing in the face of a drug epidemic RARELY does a politician admit that his child is an addict.
 Existing users are certainly consuming more of its strongest, crystalline form, known locally as "Ice".
 Most ice comes from China where a thriving pharmaceutical industry underpins its production, according to John Coyne, a former intelligence official.
 Organised drug rings are attracted to Australia, where the street value of ice is over six times that in China.
 Huge trade flows between the two countries make it relatively easy to import the drug and repatriate the profits.
 For around A$40, a hit of ice can last over half a day.
 Theoretically it still does: following the recommendations of a National Ice Task Force, it allocated A$300m to reduce demand and help addicts last year.
 Consumers are more likely to be arrested than dealers, and police put more effort into seizing drugs than into unravelling the rings that smuggle them, Mr Coyne argues.
 Huge increases in arrests and seizures have had no lasting effect on the supply or price of ice.
 "It's like sticking your finger in a bucket of water." Unfortunately, politicians find it increasingly hard to peddle "Soft" responses to a drug considered the cause of much violence.

        <p> Full Text: Efforts to preserve EU citizenship for Britons seem doomed to fail MOST of those who regret Britain's decision to leave the European Union now accept that Brexit is going to happen.
 Marriage to an EU national is another trick, as is buying Maltese or Cypriot citizenship.
 Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister who is now the European Parliament's point man for the Brexit negotiations, is promoting voluntary "Associate EU citizenship" for Britons, an idea first put forward by a fellow MEP from Luxembourg, Charles Goerens.
 A paragraph in the parliament's resolution on Brexit, adopted on April 5th, calls for some action to mitigate Britons' loss of EU citizenship.
 The benefits of such citizenship include freedom to live, work and travel around the 28-country union, to vote in European elections, to have access to health care in other EU countries and to take part in Erasmus student exchanges.
 As Adrienne Yong of the University of Hertfordshire argues, EU citizenship is not something that can just be bought and sold.
 Article 20 of the EU treaty, which created the concept, also makes clear that EU citizenship is additional to, not in place of, national citizenship of a member state.
 So a few remainers have hit on another plan, which is to challenge the government's right to take away their EU citizenship.
 Catherine Barnard, a Cambridge law professor who is a member of The UK in a Changing Europe academic network, says the Rottmann case is not a precedent, because it concerned an individual whose loss of German citizenship left him stateless, which Brexit will not do.
 Mrs May made her feelings clear last October, when she told her party conference: "If you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere." She is unlikely to welcome any plan for Britons to keep EU citizenship after Brexit.

        <p> The Fed has signalled that towards the end of 2017 it will probably begin to unwind quantitative easing, the purchase of financial assets using newly created bank reserves.
 The Fed varied the supply of bank reserves, but only to keep rates in the market for interbank loans where it wanted them to be.
 The Fed's injection of emergency liquidity into financial markets in 2008 sent interest rates tumbling.
 Because banks should not lend for less than what the Fed offers, the new policy set a floor under rates in the interbank market.
 Maintaining the set-up, as the Fed has hinted it might, means keeping banks saturated with reserves.
 Follow the money More money can increase financial stability as well as economic efficiency.
 With the Fed now raising short-term rates, shouldn't it nudge long-term rates up, too? Perhaps.
 Friedman wrote mainly about consumers' need for money, not banks'.
 Why not let individuals and firms open accounts at the Fed, and also reap the benefits of interest-bearing money? Doing so would swell the Fed's balance-sheet, but eliminate still more inefficiencies.
 The Fed may keep its balance-sheet significantly larger than it was before the crisis, even if it partly unwinds QE. Given the benefits of abundant money, that would be cause for cheer.

        <p> An investigation is under way into allegations from a former employee that Uber refuses to promote capable women or to take complaints about harassment seriously.
 Uber is not the only technology star in the spotlight for its treatment of women.
 A survey of 210 women in the valley found that 60% had experienced unwanted sexual advances and that two-thirds felt excluded from important social and networking opportunities.
 Women in tech are paid less than men, even after controlling for experience, education and responsibilities.
 Only 18% of bachelor's degrees in computer science in America were awarded to women in 2013, down from 37% in 1985.
 Being as bad as everywhere else in its treatment of women falls disappointingly short.
 Only around 6% of partners at venture-capital firms are women, down from 10% in 1999.
 Only 7% of the founders of tech startups in America that raised $20m or more are women, according to recent research by Bloomberg.
 On average, firms founded by women obtain less funding than those founded by men.
 Hiring more women in venture capital seems to increase the odds of finding and funding those elusive female entrepreneurs.

        <p> Full Text: Chen keeps spending China's HNA Group is on a global shopping spree NOW it is a conglomerate with more than $100bn-worth of assets around the world.
 HNA Group started life as a small local airline.
 Chen Feng, the Chinese company's founder, led a coalition including private investors and the government of Hainan, a southern province, to launch Hainan Airlines in 1993.
 HNA has grown quickly, mainly through acquisitions.
 Some people suspect that these deals chime with China's industrial policy more than HNA's own corporate logic.
 The Hainan government retains a big stake in it, but HNA has traits that distinguish it from state-owned enterprises, which tend to be sclerotic and run by bureaucratic grey men.
 HNA typically does not fire the top brass at firms it acquires, nor does it force big lay-offs.
 HNA is presenting this week's bid for CWT as part of President Xi Jinping's "One Belt, One Road" geopolitical strategy, for example.
 A clampdown on foreign deals by Chinese regulators, who are worried about capital outflows, has led to the cancellation of dozens of announced acquisitions by Chinese firms.
 HNA is having no trouble getting the money and approval to do lots of big deals-it has spent over $40bn on acquisitions in the past three years.

        <p> Full Text: To understand the trade-offs that Brexit Britain must make, look to EFTA NORWAY offers much to envy.
 Members of EFTA have dozens of deals, including two with China, with which the EU cannot even start negotiations.
 EFTA's half-in-half-out relationship with the EU hinders its trade as much as it helps.
 EFTA's flexibility in trade stems from its odd relationship with the EU. Switzerland has a series of bilateral agreements, whereas Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are part of the single market through the European Economic Area.
 A recent paper from the European Parliament found that EFTA tends to make trade deals faster than the EU. South Korea's talks with EFTA took half as long as those with the EU. EFTA is speedy because it can agree on a common strategy faster than the EU, which has more countries to accommodate.
 The parliament paper also notes that EFTA's agreements have been "Shallow" compared with the EU's.
 EFTA is not a big market: its partners are happy to make deals, but they are loth to spend too much time on the finer details.
 The relatively low quality of the deals helps explain why EFTA's free-trade agreements still account for only about a tenth of its members' trade.
 Britain is a much bigger market than EFTA. But it will still be in a far weaker negotiating position outside the EU than as part of the single market.
 Goods moving from EFTA to an EU member undergo "Rules of origin" checks, to ensure that the exporter is not avoiding EU tariffs.

        <p> The West must not abandon Turkey TURKEY matters not just for its size, but also as a bellwether of the political forces shaping the world.
 In recent years under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has gone backwards.
 There is nothing wrong with a strong president, but Turkey's new constitution goes too far.
 A Yes would condemn Turkey to the elected dictatorship of President Erdogan.
 Turkey is especially ill-suited to winner-takes-all government.
 If the religious-conservative near-majority try to shut out everyone else, just as they were once shut out, Turkey will never be stable.
 Some in the West will point to Turkey's experience to claim that Islam and democracy cannot coexist.
 The distinction matters because AK, or an Islamist party like it, is bound to feature in Turkey's democracy.
 As a NATO member and a regional power, Turkey is too important to cut adrift.
 Turkey will remain pivotal after April 16th. If Mr Erdogan loses, Turkey will be a difficult ally with a difficult future.

        <p> Full Text: Allegations that Google underpays women inflame a controversial debate GOOGLE has made a fortune by helping people dig up whatever information they seek.
 The accusation of lower compensation for women forms part of a lawsuit by the DoL, which has asked Google to turn over detailed information on pay.
 More than a quarter of American women in engineering, technology and science feel "Stalled" in their careers, and a third say they are likely to quit their jobs within a year, according to the Centre for Talent Innovation, a think-tank.
 The marginalisation of women in tech became a prominent subject in 2015 during a sex-discrimination lawsuit brought by Ellen Pao, who had worked at a venture-capital firm, Kleiner Perkins.
 Including Uber, are now publishing annual reports describing the composition of their workforce, after they were criticised for not hiring more women and ethnic minorities.
 Despite attempts to hire more women, they have not shifted their female-staff shares by more than a few percentage points.
 A study in 2014 that tracked women in jobs related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics found that half of women had left their professions after 12 years.
 Female venture capitalists, who are more likely to fund startups run by women, are the rarest unicorns of all in Silicon Valley.
 Transparency about the composition of firms' staff may help with hiring more women.
 The secretive nature of compensation at tech firms, with employees being discouraged from telling their peers anything about their equity grants or cash bonuses, means that women do not know when they are being underpaid, says Pamela Sayad, a San Francisco-based lawyer who specialises in workplace discrimination.

        <p> 99% of adults are now enrolled in Aadhaar, a scheme which has amassed the fingerprints and iris scans of over 1.1bn people since 2010.
 Ghosts v the machine Linking ration cards to an Aadhaar number, and thus to the biometric data tied to it, means a single person cannot have more than one and ghosts can have none.
 The original pitch to politicians-the scheme was adopted by the previous government, but has been embraced by Narendra Modi, the prime minister-was that Aadhaar would help make welfare more efficient.
 Over 400,000 ghost children were struck off school rolls in just three states after schools were required to match their pupils to Aadhaar numbers to keep receiving state funds.
 A project to purge electoral lists found 800,000 fictitious voters in Punjab, a state of 30m. The authorities suspect that 30% of driving licences are fake, many of them duplicates to help drivers evade bans-a ruse that would be impossible if all licences were linked to Aadhaar.
 The improvements in accuracy and efficiency are so enormous that the government now wants to use Aadhaar more broadly than originally advertised.
 If implemented, these new uses would put paid to the notion that enrolling in Aadhaar is voluntary, which was the promise of its backers-led by Nandan Nilekani, an IT grandee who used to chair the agency that set up Aadhaar.
 Aadhaar is a poor way to build up an Orwellian panopticon, Mr Nilekani argues, given the wealth of information already available from telephone records, GPS data, bank statements and the like.
 Unlike reading an ID card, checking someone's identity through Aadhaar requires an internet connection and, often, electricity.
 Already the Aadhaar database is being tapped 20m times a day, 20 times the rate of a year and a half ago.

        <p> Full Text: Juries acquit if sentences are harsh THOUGH no one has been executed in Britain for over 50 years, until 1998 someone convicted of high treason or "Piracy with violence" could in theory be put to death.
 The law is now clearly against capital punishment, but Britons are not.
 Research presented at this week's Royal Economic Society conference suggests that if you really want to be tough on criminals, killing off capital punishment makes sense.
 Making the necessary statistical controls, the authors looked at the change in the likelihood of conviction for offences that were no longer capital.
 The paper suggests that when capital punishment was an option, juries were often reluctant to convict at all.
 The authors find that juries were particularly reluctant to convict women.
 The paper finds that the abolition of capital punishment increased the chance of conviction for all crimes by around eight percentage points, with especially large effects for violent offences.
 The temporary halt of penal transportation during the American war of independence had a somewhat smaller effect on the likelihood to convict, suggesting that juries considered living in America to be a prospect slightly less awful than death.
 Past research has found that would-be criminals are more put off by an increased likelihood of conviction than they are by more severe sentences.
 Then getting rid of the most brutal punishments could make criminal-justice systems work better.

 RT whipped up false tales about a Russian-German teenager, "Lisa", supposedly raped by migrants in Berlin, in the hope of provoking anger among Germans of Russian origin at Angela Merkel's refugee policies.
 When their stories catch on, it is often because they are amplified online by networks of conspiracy-minded activists, Russian trolls and "Botnets".
 In 2015 Fancy Bear, a Russian cyber-espionage group, broke into computers at the Bundestag in Berlin.
 Stefan Meister, a Russia expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, reckons targets should expect any embarrassing files to appear on WikiLeaks, a whistleblowing website that likes to embarrass the enemies of Vladimir Putin, Russia's president.
 Other Russian measures involve old-fashioned ideological patronage.
 Rumours of Russian cash for nationalist parties in Italy, Greece and Hungary are more tenuous.
 Either outcome might help loosen European sanctions and boost Russian economic interests, such as the proposed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
 A recent claim promoted by Russian websites that Mrs Merkel had deliberately invited Islamic State into Germany got nowhere.
 There is no evidence that Russians have hacked Western voting machines, but ballots in the Dutch election in March were hand-counted, just in case.

        <p> Full Text: Not going round fast enough The capital's public-transport system is sputtering TRANSANTIAGO, the Chilean capital's public-transport system, had its tenth birthday in February, but no one celebrated.
 Launched with much fanfare, the scheme was supposed to integrate bus and metro lines and speed up traffic.
 Fare evasion is rampant, journeys are getting slower and the state has spent billions of dollars to prop up private bus operators.
 Passengers sometimes wait ages at stops scrawled with graffiti with no inkling of when the next bus will arrive.
 Espacio Publico, a think-tank, calls Transantiago Chile's worst public-policy project since the country returned to democracy in 1990.
 Because bus drivers no longer handle cash, the number of robberies has fallen.
 Planners laid some bus lanes directly over metro lines, so the two forms of transport compete rather than complementing each other.
 The city has hired too few inspectors to catch fare-dodgers and motorists who stray into bus lanes.
 Last month Chile's transport minister resigned, in part to take responsibility for Transantiago's failings.
 The city will have a chance to correct that next year, when contracts to operate bus lines are to expire.

        <p> Full Text: Going, going, gone? An auction house downsizes THERE was only one place to bid for Ian Fleming's typewriter, Pele's 1970 World Cup jersey or a meteorite that hit the Earth in 1803: Christie's South Kensington.
 Altogether, about 250 people will lose their jobs, mainly in Britain and continental Europe, representing about 12% of Christie's worldwide workforce.
 The most important trend shaping that market is the continuing shift in Christie's clientele away from Europe.
 Thus, as Christie's consolidates its operations onto one site in London, where James Christie founded the business in 1766, it is expanding further in China, where it is in the privileged position of being the only Western auction house with a licence to conduct sales on the mainland.
 Last October Christie's opened its third office in China, in Beijing.
 With the high costs of labour and property in London, it has also become hard to make much money on the cheaper items sold at Christie's South Kensington branch.
 The great rival of Christie's, sold its own lower-value London salesroom in Olympia in 2007.
 Last year its online sales doubled, to 50m. But some fear that the closure will impoverish Christie's in the long run, and possibly open up opportunities for Sotheby's.
 A former head of Christie's South Kensington, Anthony Coleridge, has written an open letter to Mr Pinault accusing him of destroying staff morale and damaging the Christie's brand.
 "South Kensington was where you tried things out, and brought it to St James's if it matured," says one Christie's insider.

        <p> Full Text: Germany is running out of people, starting in the east WERE it not for the graffiti on abandoned buildings, Bitterfeld-Wolfen, two towns north of Leipzig joined as one in 2007, would seem devoid of young people.
 Despite an influx of 1.2m refugees over the past two years, Germany's population faces near-irreversible decline.
 The consequences are more acute for Germany, where birth rates are lower than in Britain and France.
 If Germany is a warning for others, its eastern part is a warning for its west.
 If it were still a country, East Germany would be the oldest in the world.
 Germany has long relied on migrants to make up for low fertility rates.
 Olga Potzsch, from the Federal Statistical Office, argues that Germany will need far more migrants to stop population decline, which is predicted to accelerate from 2020.
 According to the OECD, about half of asylum-seekers who started off in eastern Germany in the past moved to places such as Hamburg once they secured their permit.
 Bitterfeld-Wolfen, it reads, is "One of the youngest cities in Germany".
 By 2050 Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain-which, unlike Germany, have all suffered net brain-drains-will be older than Germany by median age and will have shrunk substantially, according to the UN. Ageing and emigration are likely further to dampen growth in central and southern European countries, says the IMF. It calculates that by 2030 GDP per person in several countries may be 3-4% lower than it would have been without emigration.

        <p> Take the case of Egor Putilov, also known as Alexander Fridback, Tobias Lagerfeldt and Aleksandr Yarovenko.
 On June 8th 2016, Sveriges Radio, the Swedish public radio station, interviewed Mr Putilov, who identified himself as a former employee of the national migration agency.
 It found, the so-called Mr Putilov was in fact Alexander Fridback, an employee of the ultra-nationalist Sweden Democrats party.
 Mr Fridback immigrated to Sweden from Russia in 2007, apparently under the name Aleksandr Yarovenko.
 In 2011 he changed his family name to Fridback, supposedly because Swedes found Yarovenko hard to pronounce.
 In 2015 Mr Fridback wrote an opinion piece in Aftonbladet alleging that Islamic State could use the migrant crisis to infiltrate Sweden.
 Within hours, his article was picked up by Sputnik, the Russian state-controlled news agency.
 Most damningly, Sveriges Radio discovered that in 2014 Mr Fridback had bought a house in Sweden at a below-market price from a Russian criminal who was, at the time, in prison in Russia.
 No one was sure what it all meant, and Mr Fridback denies any shady connections or wrongdoing.
 Because of his exposure to Russia, security experts termed Mr Fridback a security risk, the government demanded explanations, and he ultimately left his job with the Sweden Democrats.

        <p> Full Text: Donald Trump's missile strike on Syria was justified.
 His strategy is confused and confusing THERE are good reasons to cheer the missile attack ordered by Donald Trump on a Syrian air base on April 6th. It sent a message to Bashar al-Assad, Syria's despot, that America would not tolerate his use of chemical weapons.
 Before Mr Trump saw television pictures of poisoned children, he had said that getting rid of Mr Assad was no longer a goal of American policy, as it had been, at least notionally, under Barack Obama.
 The priority for Mr Trump was the defeat of Islamic State.
 H.R. McMaster, Mr Trump's national security adviser, tried splitting the difference.
 What might Mr Trump now do about the Syrian regime's continued use of other indiscriminate weapons against civilians, such as barrel bombs packed with scrap metal? Maybe nothing.
 In Italy Mr Tillerson suddenly suggested a new policy of unlimited interventionism, saying: "We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world." A few hours later Sean Spicer, the president's press secretary, said: "If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president." Does that mean that Mr Trump now favours overthrowing Mr Assad? Surely not, for that would mean direct confrontation in the air with Russia and on the ground with Mr Assad's other ally, Iran.
 If Mr Trump is thinking about such a plan, there is no sign of it.
 Of Putin and predictability After the missile strike, any lingering notion that Mr Trump might strike a grand bargain with Russia over Syria is dead. The end of his bromance with Vladimir Putin is welcome-America's interests and Russia's are so at odds that it was always doomed to fail.
 Unpredictability has its uses in foreign policy, but it is worrying that even Mr Trump's closest aides have no idea what he will do next.

        <p> In French, son parapluie can mean either "His" or "Her" umbrella.
 The French language requires a gender for every single noun and adjective: not only men and women, bulls and cows, but also tables and chairs, rocks and bricks.
 A pattern emerges: whereas a few "Generic" words are feminine, all these powerful titles are masculine.
 Only if a woman becomes the actual president-as Marine Le Pen, of the National Front hopes to do in the French elections which begin on April 23rd-does the title become la presidente.
 The traditional use of the masculine as generic has rubbed various French people the wrong way.
 In 1984, the government called upon the French Academy to look into the question of feminising certain titles.
 In 2014, a deputy from the centre-right, Julien Aubert, sided with the academy against the chamber's rules, and repeatedly referred to the presiding officer, Sandrine Mazetier from the opposing Socialist Party, as madame le president, mixing the feminine personal title and the masculine job title.
 The academy rightly notes that in the plural, the masculine has always covered the feminine too, and writing for example tous ceux, using masculine forms, has rarely attracted much attention; the masculine is "Unmarked", meaning it carries no special meaning, whereas the feminine is "Marked", or specifically female.
 Writing toutes celles et tous ceux over and over would fill French with even more lumbering awkwardness than repeated "He or she" does in English, given the number of words it would affect in French.
 For now, mainstream French opinion is converging on a compromise between practical solutions on one hand and the French Academy's traditionalism on the other.

        <p> More important, the current president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, is breaking a taboo which Mr Zelaya was thrown out of office to protect: he is running for re-election.
 The son of Porfirio Lobo, Mr Hernandez's predecessor, has pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking.
 In 2013, the year before Mr Hernandez took office, Honduras was still the most murderous country on earth.
 Mr Hernandez has disrupted some drug-trafficking networks and shipped dozens of suspected drug lords to the United States for trial, earning the gratitude of both the Obama and Trump administrations.
 "We're paying for security with the coin of freedom," says Raul Pineda, a political analyst who supports Mr Hernandez's National Party.
 During Mr Lobo's presidency the social-security system was defrauded of $300m; a small amount of money from firms linked to the scandal helped finance Mr Hernandez's campaign.
 In March a courtroom heard a former member of Los Cachiros, a drug-trafficking gang, testify that he had met Mr Hernandez's brother, Tony.
 If Mr Hernandez wins the election, "It would validate the break with the constitution," says Edmundo Orellana, a former defence minister and foreign minister.
 Although nearly two-thirds of Hondurans oppose re-election, Mr Hernandez may well prevail.
 Mr Zelaya, a soft-spoken university professor with no political experience, is running as much against the traditional system as against Mr Hernandez.

        <p> Full Text: Faster growth makes China's debt more manageable, but fears linger GUO SHUQING, China's new banking regulator, knows the enormity of his task.
 China's banking system, he observed last month, is worth more than $33trn.
 One investment bank, Morgan Stanley, has declared that China's lenders are "In a sweet spot".
 Another, Goldman Sachs, has upgraded China to "Overweight"-that is, recommending that clients buy Chinese shares-and is especially positive about the banks.
 The clearest positive for China's banks has been an upturn in nominal economic growth.
 Banks took losses on more than 500bn yuan of loans last year, a record, scrubbing them from their books and selling some to investors.
 Overall costs of listed banks rose by just 0.6% last year, even as assets grew by 12%. All these good omens may not mean China's banks have really turned the corner.
 Jason Bedford of UBS, a Swiss bank, says that these companies, which buy delinquent loans from banks, often also finance themselves through bank loans.
 Debt-for-equity swaps are another form of financial engineering: instead of repaying loans, indebted companies can issue shares to third parties, which acquire the loans from banks.
 The upshot is that, whether stashed in bad banks or converted into equity, the debt could yet bounce back into banks' hands.

        <p> Full Text: Europe should think about what to do if Marine Le Pen wins AS USUAL, the president's first foreign trip is to the chancellery in Berlin.
 True, the looming cloud in France is hard to ignore: the first round of France's presidential election is on April 23rd, with a run-off two weeks later, and Ms Le Pen leads most first-round opinion polls.
 Ms Le Pen is unlikely to become president; France's two-round system inoculates against extremist parties like her National Front.
 Ms Le Pen aims to withdraw France from the euro, the EU's passport-free Schengen area, and possibly the EU itself.
 What should Europe expect from a Le Pen presidency? Markets would quail at her desire to quit the euro, which she describes as a "Knife in the ribs" of the French economy for denying its exporters the benefits of competitive devaluation.
 One investor predicts that a Le Pen victory would see French and Italian spreads over German government bonds rise by 2% and the euro slump below parity with the dollar.
 The mechanism for leaving the euro, says Ludovic de Danne, Ms Le Pen's Europe adviser, would be a referendum on exiting the EU altogether.
 With markets roiling, French banks under pressure and protesters filling the streets, Ms Le Pen might prefer to park the issue.
 Full withdrawal from Schengen might also mean losing access to EU police databases, which would be an odd way for Ms Le Pen to provide the security she has promised voters.
 Ms Le Pen would also target foreign-owned firms employing cheap workers from eastern Europe.

        <p> Since 2000 the annual tally of students graduating from university has increased nearly eightfold, to more than 7.5m. But many rural students are neglected by China's school system, and they are not the only ones.
 Too, are the children of migrants who have moved to the cities from the countryside and poor students who want to go to senior high school.
 The government has not been completely blind to the need to ensure that rural people have enough schooling to work in factories, but it has shown little sense of urgency.
 Since the population of young people in the countryside is falling so smaller schools are closing.
 Conditions at these boarding schools are often appalling.
 So poor is their nutrition that they are often shorter than their counterparts at day schools.
 Everyone in China has to attend school for nine years-until the end of junior high school.
 Like city dwellers, they still have to pay for senior high school.
 Their children are often barred from state-funded urban schools.
 The central government must also do more to ensure that rural schools have enough money to teach and feed their pupils-basic education is too important to be left to ill-motivated local authorities.

        <p> Having pillaged shallower waters, the world's fishing powers are looking to the mesopelagic as a new frontier.
 In September the government of Sindh, a province that is home to most of Pakistan's fishing fleet, issued a draft policy on licensing mesopelagic fishing in its waters.
 At the North Atlantic Seafood Forum, held in March, in Bergen, Norway's principal port, the session about fishing the mesopelagic was entitled "The Big Apple".
 Deep waters To try to understand the mesopelagic better, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, NASA, America's space agency, and Norway's Institute of Marine Research are all embarking on projects to study it.
 Without mesopelagic predators, far more plankton would die in the surface waters, their bodily carbon returned rapidly to the atmosphere.
 Norway, which has long paid attention to the sustainability of its fishing operations, will launch the third incarnation of Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the flagship of its marine-research fleet, in May, with an explicit focus on mapping and understanding mesopelagic life using the most advanced civilian sonar available.
 One of WHOI's research vessels will tow Deep See through the mesopelagic, gathering wide-angle camera footage and environmental data.
 WHOI's third type of mesopelagic robot will be disposable probes called Snowclops.
 In collaboration with NASA, WHOI also hopes to find variables that are observable by satellite and that correlate with the health of the mesopelagic and the size of its carbon flux.
 The forthcoming decade should serve to start answering the question of how much fishing of the mesopelagic can be undertaken without disrupting it-and with it, its role in climate regulation.

        <p> Its ten provinces and three territories see themselves as quasi-countries.
 Each province has its own ideas of how much grain dust people can be exposed to, and what sort of packages coffee creamer should come in.
 If you buy booze in one province you had better drink it there.
 Trade among provinces is less free than it is among the 28 members of the European Union.
 So politicians from the regions and federal government were in a self-congratulatory mood after they signed a "Canadian Free-Trade Agreement" on April 7th. Brad Duguid, Ontario's economy minister, who hosted the gathering, pronounced the deal "a major leap forward".
 The main change on July 1st, when the accord takes effect, will be that firms can bid more easily for contracts with governments outside their home provinces.
 The last big agreement to liberalise internal trade came in 1994, when the North American Free-Trade Agreement took effect.
 "We don't do anything unless we're forced to," sighs a former federal trade minister.
 It does not bring uniformity to the provinces' proliferation of rules, either.
 To register a standardbred horse in Quebec you must live in the province for 183 days.

        <p> Full Text: The doges would have loved it Covered in barnacles and encrustations, Damien Hirst's new art is exquisitely crafted.
 Despite the story about the shipwreck, these artworks were actually made in Mr Hirst's studios in Britain and by highly trained European craftsmen, and deposited in the Indian Ocean-off Mozambique, it is believed-where they were filmed being lifted out of the sand.
 For a long time Mr Hirst had followed art-market convention, selling his new work discreetly through his main dealers, Jay Jopling and Larry Gagosian, in an arrangement known as the "Primary market".
 Auctions, which are part of the "Secondary market", resell old work rather than fresh work that has never been sold before.
 Collectors who don't need to sell are holding on to their works, and the Hirst auction market has shrunk considerably.
 In 2008, the year of the Sotheby's sale, $223.3m-worth of Hirst work was sold at auction; a year later, with the onset of the financial crisis, volume had slumped to $14.6m. The artist's auction sales in 2016 were lower than in 2009.
 In a rare admission, White Cube, Mr Hirst's London gallery, revealed in 2013 that worldwide sales of his new work the year before had come to $110m.
 Most artists split primary sales equally with their galleries; but Mr Hirst has negotiating power and it is likely he retains more than 50% of any sale, perhaps as much as 75%. The average value of Mr Hirst's auction sales has been relatively consistent since 2009, at just over $17m a year, according to ArtTactic, a specialist research firm.
 If his primary-market sales in 2012 were similarly consistent, then Mr Hirst has been making plenty of money.
 Mr Hirst says the work cost him more than 50m to make, and Mr Pinault has paid several million more to exhibit it.

        <p> The Libyan Red Crescent said no bodies had been found from the disaster the young Gambian reported.
 One in 30 migrants in the central Mediterranean now dies en route.
 The smugglers are not just sending the migrants to sea in dinghies, or rigid inflatable boats, which were never intended for long-distance sea voyages, but in RIBs of progressively poorer quality.
 Plans have been proposed to block the traffickers' routes, which might deter migrants from assuming the appalling risks.
 The EU is training about 90 members of the Libyan coastguard, and Italy will soon return ten of the Libyans' boats that were seized in 2011.
 Blocking the dinghies would stop not only economic migrants but also asylum-seekers fleeing war and persecution.
 Its authority is challenged by Khalifa Haftar, the commander of a self-styled Libyan National Army.
 On April 2nd the Italian government announced a parallel effort to interrupt the flow of migrants, enlisting the help of dozens of rival desert tribes to secure Libya's southern frontier, which is 5,000km long.
 The Toubou peoples on Libya's border with Chad, for example, have a history of conflict with neighbouring Arab tribes which are also supposedly backing the deal.
 The area is crucial to reducing the number of migrants travelling across the Sahara.

        <p> Full Text: Why gold has not responded to geopolitical risk or reflation talk AMERICA has bombed Syria, and its relations with Russia have deteriorated.
 As the chart shows, gold took a hit when Mr Trump was elected in November and is still well below its level of last July.
 The gold price fell sharply and has stayed in a narrow range since.
 The big change in the gold market since the turn of the millennium has been the rise of exchange-traded funds, which have made it easy for investors to get exposure to the metal without worrying about storing it or insuring it.
 At the peak, gold ETFs held around 2,500 tonnes of gold, according to Citigroup, worth around $100bn at today's prices.
 Gold ETFs were bought as a classic "Momentum trade" by investors who try to make money by following trends.
 The problem with gold is that there is no obvious valuation measure.
 The general rule is that gold is seen as an alternative currency to the dollar, so when the greenback does well, bullion does badly.
 Conversely, very low interest rates mean that there seems little to lose by holding gold.
 Gold has duly perked up a bit since the start of the year, and the price rose by 1.6% on April 11th. But, although inflation may be a bit higher, nothing suggests a return to the kind of double-digit rates seen in the 1970s, when gold enjoyed a spectacular price rise.

        <p> It should be voluntary WHAT would Gandhi have made of Aadhaar, the ambitious scheme to provide each of India's 1.3bn residents with a unique, biometrically verifiable identification? There is much that might have impressed the great pacifist.
 Before Aadhaar's launch in 2010, many Indians had no proof of identity that could be recognised across the sprawling, multilingual country; now 99% of adults do.
 Aadhaar could scarcely be further removed in intent from colonial racism: it is designed to include and unite, not exclude.
 In recent months the government of Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has made access to a dozen government programmes contingent on possession of an Aadhaar card.
 In answer to a question in parliament about whether the state was, in effect, forcing citizens into the Aadhaar scheme, the reply from India's minister of finance was blunt: "Yes, we are." This would appear to contradict India's Supreme Court.
 Its judges have yet to rule on a score of petitions aimed at stopping Aadhaar, but in the past two years the court has issued several statements asserting that the identity scheme should be voluntary-or at any rate that it should remain so until the court decides otherwise.
 In theory, the law on Aadhaar passed last year by Mr Modi's government includes stringent protections against the sharing of information; its rules allowing exceptions on grounds of national security, although vaguely worded, appear well intended.
 By sneaking the linkage between Aadhaar and tax into a budget bill, it raises concerns about intent: will the government stalk tax evaders, or perhaps enemies of the state, using ostensibly "Fire-walled" Aadhaar data? Many Indians will remember that, following sectarian riots in the past, ruling parties were accused of using voter rolls to target victims.
 Mr Modi, who before taking office dismissed Aadhaar as a "Political gimmick", has been right to seize on its potential to transform India.
 For Aadhaar to fulfil its potential, Indians must trust that it will not be misused.

        <p> Full Text: The quickest way to break the ice is by submarine ARCTIC sea-ice is melting.
 The ice is still not melting fast enough.
 Some people think this approach-bludgeoning through the ice with what is, in essence, an armour-plated knife-is old-fashioned.
 For things like freeing river mouths of ice, this approach can work well.
 Hovercraft skirts are easily damaged by ridged ice, so the vehicles cannot be used in places that require frequent clearance.
 Dr Kozin's original research was on ways to permit naval submarines to surface safely and quickly through ice, the previous method having been simply to rise until contact was made with the ice sheet and then increase buoyancy until the ice cracked.
 Dr Kozin found that the bow wave from a submarine travelling close to the surface pushes the ice sheet upwards, making flexural gravity waves in it, which cause it to break up.
 Follow-up studies by Dr Kozin and his pupil, Vitaliy Zemlyak, who is now at the Sholem-Aleichem Priamursky State University in Birobidzhan, indicate that a submarine travelling 30 metres below the ice can break a sheet one metre thick.
 Comparable data are not available for Arktika, but America's heavy icebreaker, Polar Star, can break a channel through two-metre ice at a rate of three knots.
 Dr Kozin and Dr Zemlyak have also found that the area of ice broken can be increased greatly by using two submarines moving together on parallel courses, and they are now looking at increasing the pressure exerted on the ice still further, by adding wedges, spoilers and vortex generators to a submarine, or even installing an impeller, a giant propeller mounted horizontally.

        <p> Full Text: Voters no longer seem to care much about growth PUNDITS and political scientists don't always agree.
 Numerous studies have found a strong correlation between GDP growth and voting behaviour.
 After controlling for other factors, such as the number of parties in an election, a 1% increase in GDP was associated with an increase of nearly three-quarters of a percentage point in support for the incumbent government.
 Fewer voters now identify with particular parties, making elections more volatile.
 Since 2008, incumbent governments have lost on average seven percentage points of support between elections, up from three points in the 1980s.
 You might think that more voters shopping around between parties would increase the importance of objective measures such as economic performance.
 Updating data provided by Ms Dassonneville and Mr Lewis-Beck, The Economist has carried out a cross-country analysis of post-war elections in Western Europe.
 Voters have become deeply hostile towards governing parties, who now lose support regardless of how well the economy is faring.
 Incumbent governments have lost votes between elections in 29 out of 35 elections since 2008.
 If governments think more money in voters' pockets will keep them in power, they are in for a nasty surprise.

        <p> Full Text: A rare vote for No A rare vote for No A rare vote for No Voters are split over giving new powers to Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
 Ever since Mr Erdogan took power, the country has been a test of what happens when democracy is put together with political Islam.
 Early in Mr Erdogan's rule, Turkey made great progress towards democracy.
 Sitting in the AK office in Basaksehir, Mustafa Sentop, who helped draft the new constitution, argues that a man of Mr Erdogan's calibre has accomplished things in power despite the system, not because of it.
 In Turkey Mr Erdogan has spent recent years turning them into his fiefs.
 The new constitution allows Mr Erdogan to retain control of his party, giving him power to handpick parliamentary candidates.
 Much of the time, Mr Erdogan has acted under sweeping emergency powers.
 For emergency use Safak Pavey, an opposition MP, argues that Mr Erdogan has weaponised his emergency powers.
 "The law is only being used against us," she says, "Not to provide justice for everyone. Foreign policy has been weaponised, too, perhaps because Mr Erdogan thinks the referendum result is in doubt. After Germany and the Netherlands refused to accept government ministers campaigning for a Yes among Turks in their countries, Mr Erdogan accused them of"Nazi practices".
 Given Mr Erdogan's power today, what difference would victory in the referendum make? Optimists outside Turkey hope that it would inspire him to be conciliatory in an attempt to unite the country.

        <p> Full Text: Out of sight, not out of mind Out of sight, not out of mind Finland shows the way with a project expected to span 100,000 years A STEEP 5km ramp corkscrews down from the mouth of a tunnel into the bowels of the Earth.
 Finland aims to isolate its stockpile in the Onkalo repository, a burial chamber beneath the small forested island of Olkiluoto, home to one of its two nuclear-power plants, for at least 100,000 years.
 In geological terms, that is a heartbeat; Finland's bedrock is 1.9bn years old.
 Posiva's immediate priority is to create disposal caverns far enough from rock fissures and groundwater that Finland's nuclear authorities allow it to start moving the canisters to their tomb in the early 2020s.
 "Finland has a kind of unique institutional context: a high trust in experts and representative democracy," says Matti Kojo, of Finland's Tampere University.
 Finland began the search for a site in 1983, shortly after it began generating nuclear power, and chose Olkiluoto after reviewing 100 areas.
 Whether in crystalline granite, as in Finland and Sweden, or clay, as in France, or volcanic rock, as in Yucca Mountain, nuclear experts are confident that deep geological disposal can be safe.
 Finland's four nuclear reactors operate at among the world's highest utilisation rates, and supply 26% of its electricity.
 Faith in the future Some academics worry that Finland is taking waste disposal too much on faith.
 Finland's model is more closed; it would take a huge amount of digging to recover the waste once it has been sealed.

        <p> Full Text: Dosing pregnant mice with penicillin changes their offsprings' behaviour THE symbiosis between human beings and the bacteria dwelling in their guts is a delicate thing.
 There is evidence, from experiments on mice, that an absence of gut flora affects the development of the brain.
 The experiments which show these brain and behavioural changes have either been done on mice raised in sterile conditions or on ones that have had their alimentary bacterial ecosystems "Nuked" with antibiotics in high dose-far higher, pro rata, than would be administered to a human for medical reasons.
 Dr Leclercq and her colleagues, who have just published their results in Nature Communications, laced the drinking water of some pregnant female mice with medically appropriate levels of penicillin, starting a week before those females were due to give birth, and carrying on three weeks after birth, to the point where their offspring were weaned.
 A second had a bacterium called Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a so-called probiotic that has been demonstrated experimentally to be good for the intestinal health of mice, added as well.
 Those mice born of mothers given both penicillin and Lactobacillus fell between these extremes, averaging a bit under four and a half minutes in the chamber that gave them company, and three and three-quarters in the empty one.
 Dr Leclercq got similar results when she tested the preferences of her mice for social novelty.
 When Dr Leclercq and her colleagues killed and examined their animals shortly after the behavioural tests, they expected to see permeable blood-brain barriers in the mice exposed to penicillin.
 They actually saw the reverse: the blood-brain barriers of mice exposed solely to penicillin were far less permeable than those of the other two groups.
 Dr Leclercq and her colleagues have demonstrated that medically relevant doses of penicillin, even when administered via the mother rather than directly, can have palpable effects on young mice.

        <p> Full Text: Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in office has been a disappointment ASTRONOMICAL downtown rents, power cuts, traffic that gets worse by the week: these are Yangon's growing pains.
 Aung San Suu Kyi, who opposed the generals for decades before assuming the country's leadership last March, entered office with the wind at her back.
 After the landslide victory of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in elections in late 2015, donors poured in funds and expertise.
 Less than six months after Ms Suu Kyi took office, America lifted long-standing sanctions.
 These incidents point to two frequent complaints about Ms Suu Kyi's government: atrocious communication and a penchant for centralisation.
 "We don't know who to talk to, and we don't know who [Ms Suu Kyi] listens to." There are no regular exchanges between businesses, legislators and regulators, so laws are proposed before MPs understand their impact.
 Many civil-society types complain that they, too, have no access to Ms Suu Kyi's inner circle.
 Even Ms Suu Kyi's main priority, the peace process between the government and the ethnic armies that have fought it for decades, appears to be stalling.
 Ms Suu Kyi is in a tricky position: the army fears she will concede too much to the rebels, while ethnic minorities see her as just another condescending leader from the country's Burman majority, little different from her predecessors.
 Ms Suu Kyi has proved more adept at avoiding them.

        <p> If you are a bird, it has an extra question, not asked so forcefully of animals that cannot fly: "Is that extra gram of weight really necessary?" Contrary to the insult "Bird-brained", birds are not notably more stupid than mammals, but the pressure to keep organs light applies to the cerebrum as much as it does to anything else.
 For the past century birds have faced a new enemy that might require them to get smarter: the motor car.
 These days, cars and other motorised vehicles kill around 250m birds a year.
 The conclusion of this syllogism is that small-brained birds are more likely to be road-kill than large-brained birds are.
 To test this idea he needed data on a lot of dead birds.
 These details include the weights of the internal organs, and likely cause of death, of 3,521 bird specimens of 251 species.
 This time, they asked whether there was a difference between the weights of the organs of birds killed by traffic and of those that had died of other causes.
 The smaller a bird's brain, when controlled for its body size, the more likely it was to have been road-kill.
 Some 60% of the smallest-brained birds Mr Erritzoe handled had died this way.
 All this suggests a selective pressure on birds in parts of the world with lots of traffic to acquire bigger brains, even at the cost of the extra energy required to keep those brains airborne.

        <p> Full Text: Eat your heart out, Stanford For real knowledge, not just a degree, come to Ameerpet UNIVERSITY campuses can take a while to get going in the mornings, as students recover from extra-curricular antics.
 Contrast that with Ameerpet, a squeezed neighbourhood of Hyderabad that has become India's unofficial cramming-college capital.
 Fees at Ameerpet's informal institutes are typically below 25,000 rupees for classes lasting three to six months.
 The glitziest of Ameerpet's establishments have some of the trappings of MBA programmes: they dish out business cards to students they call "Trainee associates" and help them polish their CVs. But many courses that are in high demand from students from across the country are taught in primitive classrooms filled with plastic chairs.
 The focus in Ameerpet is on teaching salary-boosting skills at warp speed.
 "In college you get a degree. You come to Ameerpet for education," says Narasimham Peri, a researcher at Britain's Bristol University.
 Ameerpet succeeds because it fills the gap between Indian IT's global reach and the poor education Indians receive outside a top tier of engineering colleges.
 Prestigious government-run institutes are reluctant to allocate more seats for students and believe that quality comes through squeezing supply.
 It is surprising that Ameerpet is as busy as it is.
 Ameerpet will prevail, says Suresh Golla, who runs a popular coaching class there.

        <p> Yet on March 26th, 17 years to the day after Mr Putin was first elected, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in nearly 100 cities to demonstrate against corruption, in the largest protests since 2012.
 The protests began in Vladivostok and rolled across the country to Moscow and St Petersburg, which saw the largest crowds.
 The protests were not restricted to Mr Medvedev.
 The protests of five years ago, sparked by rigged parliamentary elections, were largely confined to Moscow and St Petersburg, and deliberately lacked unified leadership; the educated, urbane protesters considered this a sign of political maturity.
 Protests took place in industrial towns in the heartland, such as Nizhny Tagil and Chelyabinsk, and in poorer cities such as Nizhny Novgorod.
 Whereas the protests in 2011-12 had a middle-aged core, the rallies on March 26th were filled with people in their teens and 20s with few memories of their country before Mr Putin.
 With their diverse class backgrounds, the Kremlin cannot portray them as spoiled city hipsters or pitch them against blue-collar workers, as it did with the protesters five years ago.
 Unlike the 30-somethings who took to the streets back then, these younger protesters have little to lose.
 The Kremlin, which successfully suppressed the protests five years ago, has fewer tools at its disposal.
 Another favourite concept, Russia's resurgence to great-power status, is also of limited use: most of the protesters take it for granted.

        <p> Theodore Berger of the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, has proposed that brain implants might be used to store and retrieve memories.
 Mr Johnson put $100m of his own money into Kernel, stating that "Unlocking our brain is the most significant and consequential opportunity in history." In some ways, Mr Johnson and Mr Musk are merely the new boys in what is quite an old field.
 The first brain implants, carried out in the 1970s, were prosthetic visual systems, though they did not work well.
 Hundreds of thousands of people now have them-though, strictly speaking, they talk to auditory nerves rather than to the brain directly, which simplifies the task.
 For some people, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be kept in check by electrodes the diameter of a strand of spaghetti inserted deep into the brain.
 One of the latest ideas in the field is to read and interpret brain activity, in order to restore movement to the limbs of the paralysed.
 In February Mr Musk said that he thought "Meaningful" interfaces between the brain and computation were five years away.
 In a review of the field, published in January in Nature Reviews Materials, Polina Anikeeva and her colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that, although Moore's Law and the miniaturisation of electronics have brought devices down to a size where their insertion into the brain can be considered, big challenges lie ahead. The brain's complexity, and researchers' present lack of understanding of how that organ's component cells work together to do what they do, makes designing interfaces between brain and machine hard.
 Regardless of the precise approach taken to hardware, another problem the field faces is that no one understands the mechanism behind the natural equivalent of software-the way the brain encodes information.
 Instruction would be possible only if brain signals were properly understood.

        <p> Full Text: A lime-green fiasco The government's counter-terrorism campaign has a long way to go FOR four days all eyes in Bangladesh were on Atia Mahal, a lime-green, five-floor apartment block in the north-eastern city of Sylhet.
 The police cordoned off the building on March 24th after receiving word that a group of Islamic militants had holed up in one of its flats.
 It was the first indiscriminate suicide-attack on civilians in Bangladesh.
 Islamic State, the jihadist group that runs a dwindling portion of Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attack, its 28th in Bangladesh since 2015.
 The government insists-to near-universal disbelief-that the perpetrators are a new faction of a home-grown group called Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh.
 Its appeasement of extreme religious groups such as Hefazat-e-Islam, which share much of the militants' worldview, is at odds with the crackdown.
 Bangladesh's neighbour, India, will also be worried.
 This month its Border Security Force warned that more than 3,000 militants had entered India across its border with Bangladesh, the world's fifth-longest.
 India has three main security concerns: that Bangladesh is a haven for various insurgent groups fighting the Indian government; that large numbers of illegal migrants from Bangladesh are changing the ethnic and religious character of the border areas; and that Bangladesh is turning away from its long history of secularism and tolerance.
 Sheikh Hasina has tried to suppress the insurgents using Bangladesh as a base for operations in India, with some success.

        <p> Full Text: The nominee to run the Food and Drug Administration is a sound pick WHEN the names of potential candidates for the new head of America's regulatory agency for drugs, the Food and Drug Administration, were first circulated, you could almost hear the sound of jaws hitting desks throughout the pharmaceuticals industry.
 The idea of not approving drugs for efficacy is as unwelcome to the industry as it is to doctors and patients.
 It spends billions of dollars every year on research to deliver better treatments; this would be impossible to justify if drugs had merely to be safe.
 Mr Gottlieb will certainly wish to find more ways of speeding drug approvals.
 In some cases it is clear that the demand for ever-larger clinical trials of new drugs has done little for safety, raised costs and rewarded chiefly the very largest companies that can afford to run them.
 GlaxoSmithKline, a British pharmaceutical group, recently completed the world's first such test for a drug, Relvar, which treats asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Generic drugs is another area where Mr Gottlieb has signalled his views.
 He may want to tackle the rising cost and complexity of filing applications to market generic drugs-the problem that allowed Martin Shkreli, a controversial entrepreneur, to raise the price of Daraprim, an anti-parasitic drug, by 5,000% in 2015, causing fury.
 Sudip Parikh, a policy adviser at the Drug Information Association, another think-tank, says the rate of change means that decades-old rules and regulations may not function well for new treatments.
 The FDA is a complicated agency of 17,000 staff and Mr Gottlieb may have little financial room for manoeuvre: under Donald Trump and a Republican Congress, the hope of more funds is slim.

        <p> Full Text: The world has made amazing progress in eradicating extreme poverty.
 Since then the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by about 1bn and the number of non-poor people has gone up by roughly 4bn. By 2013, the most recent year for which reliable data exist, just 10.7% of the world's population was poor.
 Poverty has almost certainly retreated further since 2013: the World Bank's finger-in-the-wind estimate for 2016 is 9.1%. Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, calculates that someone escapes extreme poverty every 1.2 seconds.
 The share of people living in absolute poverty will almost certainly not decline as quickly in the future-and not because it will hit zero and therefore have nowhere to fall.
 Even as the global proportion of poor people continues to drift slowly downwards, large pockets of poverty will persist, and some of them are likely to swell.
 In 1987 China is thought to have had 660m poor people, and India 374m. The concentration of destitution in those two countries was in one sense a boon, because in both places better economic policies allowed legions to scramble out of poverty.
 Because Africa's population is growing so quickly-by about 2.5% a year, compared with 1% for Asia-and because the poverty rate is declining only slowly, the number of poor Africans is higher than it was in the 1990s.
 With huge numbers of people who are barely out of poverty, it now needs to prevent near-paupers from falling back, while also dragging the poorest out of destitution faster than economic growth alone could do the job.
 The world is now supposed to cut the absolute poverty rate to 9% by 2020 and 3% by 2030.
 Still, a global target for reducing absolute poverty seems increasingly beside the point, because poverty is less and less global.

        <p> The 34-year-old Mr Kovac woke up in Austria, where police arrested him in connection with a German financial probe.
 Slovak police and justice officials investigating the kidnapping were frustrated when a key witness went into hiding and his police contact was killed with a car-bomb.
 It pinned the crime on private thugs hired by the Slovak secret services, whose head, Ivan Lexa, was the right-hand man of Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister at the time.
 The senior Mr Kovac was a political opponent of Mr Meciar's.
 Before charges could be brought, Mr Meciar passed an amnesty law that buried the case.
 Mr Meciar has spent the past few years in quiet retirement at his mansion, christened "Elektra".
 Mr Meciar felt obliged to appear on television to defend himself.
 Polls showed that 63% of Slovaks favoured revoking the amnesty law, and on March 13th Robert Fico, the current prime minister, announced that he would do so.
 He may be defending himself against any appearance of complicity; his first government, in 2006, included Mr Meciar's party.
 Any punishment will come too late for the elder Mr Kovac.

        <p> Full Text: A gesture Moon may soon be repeating Moon Jae-in lost the presidency to Park Geun-hye.
 Her ruin may be his redemption "MY BEST quality is that I am persistent. My worst is that I am no fun." Moon Jae-in's assessment of himself in "South Korea Asks", a series of interviews published in January, is one with which many South Koreans, whether they like or loathe him, would probably agree.
 The country now faces a snap presidential election on May 9th. After almost a decade of conservative rule, the ballot looks likely to be a victory for the more socially liberal Minjoo party: its support is the highest it has ever been, at 50%. Mr Moon, who led the party until January last year, has topped the polls for president for almost three months.
 Mr Moon is well ahead. And in the election proper, it is hard to imagine Mr Moon's opponents coalescing with enough enthusiasm around one of the other candidates to deny him the presidency.
 In a recent televised debate among the Minjoo candidates, Mr Moon said he would be a "Gwanghwamun president", referring to the district in the centre of Seoul where millions rallied over five months to demand Ms Park's dismissal.
 Mr Moon says he would do away with the presidential guard, making do with protection from the police instead. Before her impeachment, Ms Park refused to co-operate with the prosecutors; after it, she appeared to rebuke the constitutional court by saying the truth would "Eventually be known".
 The groundswell against Ms Park has dampened the influence of conservative media outlets; their attacks on Mr Moon have had little impact.
 Many on the right continue to associate Mr Moon with Roh, his liberal mentor and a beacon for South Korea's left.
 Mr Moon says he would visit North Korea before any other country if he thought it would help negotiations, and wants to re-open the Kaesong industrial complex, a joint manufacturing facility on the border that had been the last point of co-operation between the two governments until Ms Park shut it in 2016.
 In much the same vein, Mr Moon says he wants to overcome South Korea's regional divisions.

        <p> Full Text: A simple device can warn the wearer of noxious substances NERVE agents such as sarin and VX can kill quickly in low doses.
 At the moment, there is no simple way for soldiers in the field, or inspectors looking for manufacturing and storage sites, to detect nerve agents.
 Sarin, VX and their kind are chemicals called organophosphorus compounds, which can be deactivated by an enzyme known as organophosphorus hydrolase.
 Existing nerve-agent detectors record changes induced by the presence of organophosphorus compounds in the electrical resistance of gels impregnated with this enzyme.
 To make their device, he and his colleagues print electrodes made of silver and silver chloride, and of carbon, onto the index fingers of rubber gloves.
 The zone of near-meeting is coated with a layer of gel containing organophosphorus hydrolase.
 The gel connects the ends of the electrodes together, completing the circuit.
 The knuckle-ends of the electrodes are designed to meet a special ring, worn over the glove, that both supplies them with current and transmits information on the strength of that current to a nearby mobile phone-setting off an alarm if the current varies in a way that indicates the enzyme is reacting with a nerve agent.
 To gather a residue sample from a surface, the glove's thumb has a carbon disc printed onto it which the wearer rubs across a suspicious area.
 Tests with organophosphorus compounds smeared on glass, wood, stainless steel and plastic, and also four types of fruit and vegetable, suggest the idea works in principle.

 After the military regime in Myanmar refused to recognise the colossal victory of her National League for Democracy party in an election in 1990, Aung San Suu Kyi endured 25 years of persecution, including 15 years under house arrest.
 Ms Suu Kyi's dignified resistance to military rule has made her a hero to many around the world-and deservedly so.
 In a parting gift from the army, Myanmar's constitution bars Ms Suu Kyi from the presidency on the grounds that her children hold British citizenship.
 Members of parliament complain that they have little role in government; Ms Suu Kyi makes all the decisions that matter.
 Ms Suu Kyi has decided to focus her attention on bringing peace to the far corners of the country, where a bewildering array of ethnic militias have fought the government for decades.
 Ms Suu Kyi has more authority in other areas-most notably over the economy-but has not done much with it.
 Ms Suu Kyi has made little effort to overhaul the courts, which are stuffed with corrupt holdovers from the old regime, or make them more accessible.
 International goodwill towards the new government is being squandered by Ms Suu Kyi's shameful silence about the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority who live near the border with Bangladesh.
 Ms Suu Kyi cannot even bring herself to use the word Rohingya, let alone condemn the army's treatment of them.

        <p> Full Text: Mr Kochevar eats his lunch A device that lets a paralysed patient control his arm offers hope to others DURING a 250km bike ride for charity in Ohio, William Kochevar found himself cycling behind a post-office van when it pulled over to make deliveries.
 Bolu Ajiboye and Bob Kirsch, biomedical engineers at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, used functional magnetic-resonance imaging to locate nerve cells responsible for arm movements in the left motor cortex of Mr Kochevar's brain.
 The technique highlighted a patch of his brain to which the blood supply increased whenever Mr Kochevar imagined moving his right arm.
 The team then implanted at that spot two 4x4mm chips, known as Utah arrays, each armed with 96 tiny electrodes, to measure the electrical activity of the 100 or so nerve cells there.
 With the Utah arrays in place, Mr Kochevar was asked to imagine moving a virtual arm in a computer simulation, and, later, to imagine moving his own arm while it was being moved for him.
 The patterns of electrical activity from the nerve cells firing in Mr Kochevar's brain were fed to a computer algorithm, which matched them to the motions of the virtual arm and later, his own arm.
 The algorithm was able to detect brain activity associated with Mr Kochevar's intention to move his arm and then trigger the contraction of muscles needed to bring about the desired motion.
 Because Mr Kochevar had lost the nerves required to move many of his shoulder muscles, his arm movements were assisted by a motorised platform, which he also controlled remotely.
 The technique Dr Ajiboye and Dr Kirsch employed to achieve all this, which is called functional electrical stimulation, has been used in monkeys and has also permitted paralysed human patients to move a robotic arm.
 Both the brain electrodes and the electrodes to the arm and hand are connected to the outside world by cables.

        <p> Full Text: Not quite what Madison had in mind Not quite what Madison had in mind Not quite what Madison had in mind THE morning after Donald Trump was elected president, Eric Schneiderman, the Democratic attorney-general of New York, summoned his raddled senior lawyers to a war council.
 While the president-elect was digesting his victory in Trump Tower, five miles up the road, Mr Schneiderman put scores of the 650 lawyers at his disposal on Trump watch.
 With the Republicans who control Congress apparently unwilling to hold Mr Trump to account, Mr Schneiderman feared that Democratic attorneys-general might have to act as a thin blue line of resistance to an authoritarian president.
 According to the fact-checkers at the Washington Post, Mr Trump uttered 317 "False or misleading" statements in his first 63 days as president.
 The failure of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on March 24th to pass a health-care bill on which Mr Trump had staked his image as America's closer-in-chief shows that the president cannot carry all before him.
 The 30-odd right-wingers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, who opposed the repeal bill, causing Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, to withdraw it, intended no rebuke to Mr Trump.
 The president impugned the legitimacy of the first obstructive beak, James Robart-a George W. Bush appointee whom Mr Trump described as a "So-called judge".
 Though Mr Trump is sometimes compared to the White House's last big rule breaker, Richard Nixon, he appears much less competent.
 If an FBI investigation into the Russia connection turned up something serious, a Republican congress would still be loth to impeach Mr Trump.
 As the Washington Post has reported, he has spent almost a third of his time as president at a Trump-branded property, including his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where club members have been treated to the sight of the president urgently discussing North Korean missile launches over salad. Because another of his presidential haunts, the Trump International hotel, a short walk along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, is also popular with foreign dignitaries, Mr Trump has been sued over an obscure clause of the constitution that forbids public servants from accepting fees or gifts from a foreign state.

        <p> Full Text: Weak electricity demand in China and India is clouding the outlook for coal THE Hazelwood power station in Australia's state of Victoria started generating electricity 52 years ago.
 The stark symbol of an era when coal was king, Hazelwood was one of Australia's dirtiest: its fuel was the Latrobe valley's brown coal, a bigger polluter than the black sort.
 Australia has shut ten coal-fired power stations over the past seven years, yet coal still generates about three-quarters of its electricity.
 The biggest economies besides Japan, which hopes to replace nuclear with "Clean" coal, are either closing down old plants or rethinking plans to build new ones.
 Firstly, electricity demand is stagnant, falling or growing less strongly than expected, which has put considerable financial strain on power plants burning coal.
 As the cost of renewables becomes more competitive with coal, it further blackens its future.
 Coal's first headache, the falling energy intensity of economic growth, is a common feature in the rich world, as economies switch from manufacturing towards services, use more LED lighting and make appliances such as refrigerators and air-conditioners more energy-efficient.
 The same year, China's coal demand plummeted by about 4%. For similar reasons, India's growth in electricity demand, at around 5% a year, lags behind that of GDP as a whole, at about 7%. In both India and China, authorities have overestimated the growth in electricity consumption, procuring coal-fired power that is not used by the grid.
 The result is that coal plants in both countries are operating far below their potential capacity, says Tim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an environmental think-tank.
 In the meantime renewable energy prices are falling fast, making the investment case for coal even bleaker.

        <p> Full Text: As Brexit begins, Britain is due for a brutal encounter with reality.
 Theresa May's dispatch of a letter to the European Council on March 29th, invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty, marked the point at which Britain's withdrawal from the union became all but inevitable.
 The task of unwinding Britain's membership of the club is fearsomely complex.
 In Britain, where Brexit increasingly resembles a faith-based initiative, voters have been given wildly unrealistic expectations of the Utopia ahead. Their first contact with the reality of losing preferential access to their main market will be traumatic.
 Unless Mrs May can persuade the Brexiteers on her own side that they must accept concessions, Britain may end up flouncing out of Europe without any deal at all.
 The EU wants to fix the terms of the Article 50 divorce, covering such matters as the rights of citizens resident in other countries and Britain's multi-billion-euro exit bill, before starting work on a future trade deal; Mrs May wants to negotiate on everything at once.
 Mrs May's priority is to fulfil the Leave campaign's promise to "Take back control" by ending the free movement of EU citizens to Britain and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
 Unless Britain accepts these, which implies a role for the system's referee, the ECJ, it cannot operate freely in the single market-as even American firms trading in the EU have found.
 To revert to trading with the EU only on World Trade Organisation terms would cause serious harm to Britain's economy.
 There is a possibility of a deal between Britain and the EU that minimises Brexit's harm.

        <p> Full Text: Frills and spills Slowly but surely Britain's flag-carrier is becoming a no-frills airline ALONGSIDE "Rip-off" energy companies, Sir Philip Green and anyone who thinks that a hard Brexit is not brilliant news, Britain's tabloid newspapers have a new hate figure: British Airways.
 Britain's flag-carrier prides itself as a premium airline, a cut above budget operations such as easyJet and Ryanair.
 Now BA is trimming the frills too, leaving its frequent flyers irate.
 The Sun has renamed the airline "British Bareways".
 Although BA is copping plenty of criticism, its strategy looks a sound one.
 The kerfuffle stems from BA's efforts to cut costs.
 It recently got rid of free food and drink in economy class on most short-haul flights (instead it is selling sandwiches and Percy Pig sweets from Marks.

        <p> Full Text: By importing goods, rich countries export air pollution-and with it, deaths GOVERNMENTS fret over traffic and other local nuisances that create filthy air.
 Research just published in Nature by Zhang Qiang, of Tsinghua University in Beijing, and an international team including environmental economists, physicists and disease experts, suggests the problem has a global dimension, too.
 Dr Zhang's analysis estimates that in 2007-the first year for which complete industrial, epidemiological and trade data were available when the team started work-more than 3m premature deaths around the world were caused by emissions of fine particulate matter.
 Of these, the team reckon just under an eighth were associated with pollutants released in a part of the world different from that in which the death occurred, thanks to transport of such particles from place to place by the wind.
 Almost twice as many were a consequence of goods and services that were produced in one region and then exported for consumption in another.
 In effect, such rich countries are exporting air pollution, and its associated deaths, as they import goods.
 As far as China is concerned, that phenomenon is probably abating.
 Chinese coal consumption has been on the wane since 2013, so premature deaths there from toxic air are now probably dropping.
 Other industrialising countries, such as India, may yet see an increase.

        <p> On July 15th last year, alarmed by reports of an army coup, Mr Unal was injured in a forlorn attempt to block a pair of tanks roaring down an Istanbul avenue.
 "As long as I can remember," he says, "I have been against coups everywhere." The shock of the coup, the bloodiest in Turkey's history, and the courage of thousands of people like Mr Unal who risked their lives to oppose it, has been overshadowed in the world beyond Turkey's borders by the mass purges, detentions and reports of torture that followed it.
 To legitimise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's draconian policies and to boost his attempt to bolster his powers through a new constitution, the memory and trauma of the coup have been nourished, politicised and consecrated.
 In Mr Erdogan's hands, the coup has turned into the cornerstone of what the president and his supporters refer to as the "New Turkey": a more religious, more anti-Western and less predictable incarnation of the republic founded by Kemal Ataturk over nine decades ago.
 Universities, parks, stadiums, swimming pools and other landmarks across the country, including the Bosporus bridge where soldiers fired on unarmed protesters, have been renamed after the coup and its victims.
 At the start of the school year, children across the country were made to watch a video that moved seamlessly between footage of the coup and images of Ottoman troops squaring off against Allied forces during the first world war.
 Mr Erdogan compares the coup to Turkey's war of independence.
 His aides reach for even more creative historical parallels.
 July 15th was a "Revolution" that will shape Turkey "Just as much as 1789 influenced France and just as the Bolshevik revolution influenced Russia", says Mehmet Ucum, a presidential adviser.
 The coup exposed and brought down the "Antidemocratic structure" within the bureaucracy, Mr Ucum claims.

        <p> Full Text: Major Adrian Coles, champion of Britain's hedgehogs, died on March 23rd, aged 86 "FROM Clee to heaven the beacon burns," runs the opening line of A.E. Housman's "A Shropshire Lad".
 Its turning point came in 1982, when his small daughter ran in to tell him that a hedgehog was stuck under the cattle grid at the end of the drive.
 There were probably hedgehogs stuck under cattle grids all over Britain.
 Major Coles found himself getting exercised about hedgehogs.
 If Britain had a favourite wild animal, it was probably not the fox, gallant but verminous, or the hare, magical but moonstruck, but the bright-eyed pointy-nosed hedgehog, suddenly appearing on lawns at dusk like the head of an old brush.
 These included 700 "Carers" who would provide an injured hedgehog with a hot-water bottle and a warm box, or put the small pink feet in splints.
 Letters would arrive from abroad addressed to "Major Hedgehog, England".
 A grand moment came in 2014, when an exhibit called "Hedgehog Street" won a gold medal at the Royal Horticultural Society's show at Hampton Court.
 Major Coles, now widowed and living at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, presided in his scarlet pensioner's coat with his service medals, and with a camera-shy hedgehog in his lap.
 The pub had renamed itself "The Cross Hedgehog" for the occasion.

        <p> Full Text: Carmakers will need to get bigger to compete for the future of mobility CARS are getting bigger.
 Four car firms now make around 10m vehicles a year in order to reap economies of scale, particularly in the mass-market bit of the business where profit margins can be painfully thin.
 Most car bosses are still reticent about taking the plunge on mergers because many have been catastrophes.
 A deal would bring little benefit in Europe, where VW already has a big slice of the market and plenty of small cars on offer.
 Scale would allow car firms to spread the cost over more vehicles.
 One argument against full-scale mergers has been that loose alliances, such as that between Renault, a French car manufacturer, and Japan's Nissan, can do the job by helping to pool development costs.
 After taking a controlling stake in Mitsubishi, a smaller Japanese carmaker, last year, the firm makes nearly 10m cars a year.
 One of GM's reasons for getting rid of Opel was to concentrate on profits rather than solely on how many cars it turns out, a decision that Tim Urquhart of IHS Markit, a research firm, calls "Groundbreaking and brave".
 A mega-merger would take similar courage, and car bosses tend to be conservative and risk-averse.
 After over 100 years of selling cars powered by internal-combustion engines, the industry faces the huge wrench of adapting to a future of electrification and self-driving cars.

        <p> Lost in the row were the millions of refugees who stayed in the developing world, unwilling or unable to journey to richer countries.
 The starting point of "Refuge" by Alexander Betts and Paul Collier, a refugee expert and a development economist, is the plight of the 86% of refugees who live in poor countries.
 Although the number of people displaced by conflict or persecution is at a post-war high of 65m, more salient is the length of their exile: about half the world's refugees have endured their status for more than five years.
 The big argument of "Refuge" is that refugees should be given jobs rather than coddled as victims, and that governments should harness the forces of globalisation and capitalism to help.
 The authors' Eureka moment came in Jordan in 2015, when they were shown a low-tax "Special economic zone" near Zaatari, a refugee camp.
 To test their ideas Messrs Betts and Collier have helped establish a pilot scheme in Jordan, with help from Western governments and companies like Asda, a British supermarket, which uses suppliers that hire refugees in the zone.
 Where does the West fit in? The authors slam Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, for triggering huge movements of refugees and migrants to Europe by relaxing entry rules for Syrians in August 2015.
 Rather than argue for rich countries to take in ever more refugees, the authors urge them to offer political and economic help to "Havens" like Jordan and Kenya, including financial incentives for firms to invest.
 Perhaps a bigger problem is that "Refuge" provides no guide on how to handle today's mixed flows of economic migrants and refugees.
 A few eyebrows will also be raised at the claim that Europe's refugee flows were responsible for Britain's vote to leave the EU. But this should not detract from the humanity of a book that places the long-term needs of the world's refugees at its heart.

        <p> Full Text: The old Carrie Lam Carrie Lam's education policies will not defuse political tensions in schools THE leader of Hong Kong, Leung Chung-ying, will not be widely missed when he steps down at the end of June, especially by the young.
 Their "Umbrella Movement" was the biggest act of civil disobedience in the territory's history and spawned new groups demanding "Self-determination" for Hong Kong.
 Mrs Lam is widely remembered for her obduracy in a televised debate with student leaders during the Umbrella unrest.
 As chief executive, Mrs Lam will still have no freedom to propose political reform unless China wants it.
 Instead of dwelling on politics, Mrs Lam is trying to show concern for students' welfare.
 Unlike Mr Leung, who supported rigorous testing of students even at a very young age, Mrs Lam talks of a need to "Reduce pressure" on them.
 Mrs Lam wants the testing to be scrapped altogether.
 During her campaign to become chief executive, Mrs Lam promised to increase the annual budget for education by HK$5bn, or nearly 7%, noting that government spending on this was below the average in wealthy economies.
 She is widely expected to replace the unpopular education secretary, Eddie Ng. But Mrs Lam's reforms will do little to ease older students' political frustrations, including their resentment of the Communist Party's insistence on "Patriotism".
 Last month the main advisory body to the parliament in Beijing urged its members from Hong Kong to visit schools in the territory to talk about "National conditions".
