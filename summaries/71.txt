 Full Text: Major Adrian Coles, champion of Britain's hedgehogs, died on March 23rd, aged 86 "FROM Clee to heaven the beacon burns," runs the opening line of A.E. Housman's "A Shropshire Lad".
 Its turning point came in 1982, when his small daughter ran in to tell him that a hedgehog was stuck under the cattle grid at the end of the drive.
 There were probably hedgehogs stuck under cattle grids all over Britain.
 Major Coles found himself getting exercised about hedgehogs.
 If Britain had a favourite wild animal, it was probably not the fox, gallant but verminous, or the hare, magical but moonstruck, but the bright-eyed pointy-nosed hedgehog, suddenly appearing on lawns at dusk like the head of an old brush.
 These included 700 "Carers" who would provide an injured hedgehog with a hot-water bottle and a warm box, or put the small pink feet in splints.
 Letters would arrive from abroad addressed to "Major Hedgehog, England".
 A grand moment came in 2014, when an exhibit called "Hedgehog Street" won a gold medal at the Royal Horticultural Society's show at Hampton Court.
 Major Coles, now widowed and living at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, presided in his scarlet pensioner's coat with his service medals, and with a camera-shy hedgehog in his lap.
 The pub had renamed itself "The Cross Hedgehog" for the occasion.
