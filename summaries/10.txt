 Full Text: America is gearing up for another debate over network neutrality THE details around network neutrality, the principle that internet-service providers must treat all sorts of web traffic equally, can be mind-numbingly abstruse.
 In the coming days Mr Pai is expected to unveil a proposal for new rules on net neutrality.
 Because of the protests in 2014 and because of a court decision that year suggesting that the FCC needed the jurisdiction to be able to mandate net-neutrality rules, Mr Wheeler reclassified internet access as a "Telecommunications service" to be under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning that ISPs are regulated as utilities.
 Mr Pai does support general rules to protect net neutrality.
 Once ISPs are no longer classed as telecommunications services he wants them to commit to net neutrality in their terms of service.
 The ISPs' commitments would, at bottom, be voluntary, as critics such as Chris Lewis of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group, note.
 ISPs could refuse to make promises on net neutrality, or abandon them down the line.
 Mr Pai may risk going too far even for his own comfort on net neutrality.
 The logical answer to this legal conundrum would be for Congress to add a statute on net neutrality to the Telecommunications Act, which predates the rise of the internet.
 Such a compromise would also be in tune with how the debate about net neutrality has evolved.
