 As the bloodsucker feeds on a human, in some parts of the world there is the chance it will transmit the larvae of worms which cause a disease called lymphatic filariasis.
 Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, guinea-worm disease, leishmaniasis, river blindness, trachoma and yaws are some of the 18 now collectively referred to as "Neglected tropical diseases".
 The resulting disabilities keep sufferers mired in poverty; that poverty is also what allows the diseases to thrive.
 David Molyneux, a parasitologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has been working on tropical diseases since 1965.
 The first human trial of ivermectin for river blindness was in Senegal in 1981, in patients who had the early stages of the disease but no damage to their eyes.
 Together with several more trials, it showed that ivermectin was safe in humans and highly effective at killing the disease vector in its larval state.
 Prevalences had to be mapped, and, for some of the diseases, individual patients diagnosed.
 In an article in 2004 in the Lancet, a medical journal, Dr Molyneux argued that these diseases were unfairly neglected in comparison with tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS, which were the subject of well-funded global programmes.
 Experience in a range of countries showed that these diseases could be controlled, he reminded his readers-and doing so brought dividends besides the relief of great suffering.
 Each dollar spent on the control of lymphatic filariasis in China, or Chagas disease in Brazil, has been estimated to produce benefits of $15 and $17 respectively, by reducing spending on treatment and cutting the number of prematurely curtailed working lives.
