 More important, the current president, Juan Orlando Hernandez, is breaking a taboo which Mr Zelaya was thrown out of office to protect: he is running for re-election.
 The son of Porfirio Lobo, Mr Hernandez's predecessor, has pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking.
 In 2013, the year before Mr Hernandez took office, Honduras was still the most murderous country on earth.
 Mr Hernandez has disrupted some drug-trafficking networks and shipped dozens of suspected drug lords to the United States for trial, earning the gratitude of both the Obama and Trump administrations.
 "We're paying for security with the coin of freedom," says Raul Pineda, a political analyst who supports Mr Hernandez's National Party.
 During Mr Lobo's presidency the social-security system was defrauded of $300m; a small amount of money from firms linked to the scandal helped finance Mr Hernandez's campaign.
 In March a courtroom heard a former member of Los Cachiros, a drug-trafficking gang, testify that he had met Mr Hernandez's brother, Tony.
 If Mr Hernandez wins the election, "It would validate the break with the constitution," says Edmundo Orellana, a former defence minister and foreign minister.
 Although nearly two-thirds of Hondurans oppose re-election, Mr Hernandez may well prevail.
 Mr Zelaya, a soft-spoken university professor with no political experience, is running as much against the traditional system as against Mr Hernandez.
