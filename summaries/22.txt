 The West must not abandon Turkey TURKEY matters not just for its size, but also as a bellwether of the political forces shaping the world.
 In recent years under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has gone backwards.
 There is nothing wrong with a strong president, but Turkey's new constitution goes too far.
 A Yes would condemn Turkey to the elected dictatorship of President Erdogan.
 Turkey is especially ill-suited to winner-takes-all government.
 If the religious-conservative near-majority try to shut out everyone else, just as they were once shut out, Turkey will never be stable.
 Some in the West will point to Turkey's experience to claim that Islam and democracy cannot coexist.
 The distinction matters because AK, or an Islamist party like it, is bound to feature in Turkey's democracy.
 As a NATO member and a regional power, Turkey is too important to cut adrift.
 Turkey will remain pivotal after April 16th. If Mr Erdogan loses, Turkey will be a difficult ally with a difficult future.
