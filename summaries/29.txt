 Full Text: Germany is running out of people, starting in the east WERE it not for the graffiti on abandoned buildings, Bitterfeld-Wolfen, two towns north of Leipzig joined as one in 2007, would seem devoid of young people.
 Despite an influx of 1.2m refugees over the past two years, Germany's population faces near-irreversible decline.
 The consequences are more acute for Germany, where birth rates are lower than in Britain and France.
 If Germany is a warning for others, its eastern part is a warning for its west.
 If it were still a country, East Germany would be the oldest in the world.
 Germany has long relied on migrants to make up for low fertility rates.
 Olga Potzsch, from the Federal Statistical Office, argues that Germany will need far more migrants to stop population decline, which is predicted to accelerate from 2020.
 According to the OECD, about half of asylum-seekers who started off in eastern Germany in the past moved to places such as Hamburg once they secured their permit.

 By 2050 Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain-which, unlike Germany, have all suffered net brain-drains-will be older than Germany by median age and will have shrunk substantially, according to the UN. Ageing and emigration are likely further to dampen growth in central and southern European countries, says the IMF. It calculates that by 2030 GDP per person in several countries may be 3-4% lower than it would have been without emigration.
