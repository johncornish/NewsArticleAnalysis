 Full Text: Donald Trump's missile strike on Syria was justified.
 His strategy is confused and confusing THERE are good reasons to cheer the missile attack ordered by Donald Trump on a Syrian air base on April 6th. It sent a message to Bashar al-Assad, Syria's despot, that America would not tolerate his use of chemical weapons.
 Before Mr Trump saw television pictures of poisoned children, he had said that getting rid of Mr Assad was no longer a goal of American policy, as it had been, at least notionally, under Barack Obama.
 The priority for Mr Trump was the defeat of Islamic State.
 H.R. McMaster, Mr Trump's national security adviser, tried splitting the difference.
 What might Mr Trump now do about the Syrian regime's continued use of other indiscriminate weapons against civilians, such as barrel bombs packed with scrap metal? Maybe nothing.
 In Italy Mr Tillerson suddenly suggested a new policy of unlimited interventionism, saying: "We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world." A few hours later Sean Spicer, the president's press secretary, said: "If you gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president." Does that mean that Mr Trump now favours overthrowing Mr Assad? Surely not, for that would mean direct confrontation in the air with Russia and on the ground with Mr Assad's other ally, Iran.
 If Mr Trump is thinking about such a plan, there is no sign of it.
 Of Putin and predictability After the missile strike, any lingering notion that Mr Trump might strike a grand bargain with Russia over Syria is dead. The end of his bromance with Vladimir Putin is welcome-America's interests and Russia's are so at odds that it was always doomed to fail.
 Unpredictability has its uses in foreign policy, but it is worrying that even Mr Trump's closest aides have no idea what he will do next.
