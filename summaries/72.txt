 Four car firms now make around 10m vehicles a year in order to reap economies of scale, particularly in the mass-market bit of the business where profit margins can be painfully thin.
 Most car bosses are still reticent about taking the plunge on mergers because many have been catastrophes.
 A deal would bring little benefit in Europe, where VW already has a big slice of the market and plenty of small cars on offer.
 Scale would allow car firms to spread the cost over more vehicles.

 After over 100 years of selling cars powered by internal-combustion engines, the industry faces the huge wrench of adapting to a future of electrification and self-driving cars.
