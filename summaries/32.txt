 In French, son parapluie can mean either "His" or "Her" umbrella.
 The French language requires a gender for every single noun and adjective: not only men and women, bulls and cows, but also tables and chairs, rocks and bricks.
 A pattern emerges: whereas a few "Generic" words are feminine, all these powerful titles are masculine.
 Only if a woman becomes the actual president-as Marine Le Pen, of the National Front hopes to do in the French elections which begin on April 23rd-does the title become la presidente.
 The traditional use of the masculine as generic has rubbed various French people the wrong way.
 In 1984, the government called upon the French Academy to look into the question of feminising certain titles.
 In 2014, a deputy from the centre-right, Julien Aubert, sided with the academy against the chamber's rules, and repeatedly referred to the presiding officer, Sandrine Mazetier from the opposing Socialist Party, as madame le president, mixing the feminine personal title and the masculine job title.
 The academy rightly notes that in the plural, the masculine has always covered the feminine too, and writing for example tous ceux, using masculine forms, has rarely attracted much attention; the masculine is "Unmarked", meaning it carries no special meaning, whereas the feminine is "Marked", or specifically female.
 Writing toutes celles et tous ceux over and over would fill French with even more lumbering awkwardness than repeated "He or she" does in English, given the number of words it would affect in French.
 For now, mainstream French opinion is converging on a compromise between practical solutions on one hand and the French Academy's traditionalism on the other.
