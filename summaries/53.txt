 Yet on March 26th, 17 years to the day after Mr Putin was first elected, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in nearly 100 cities to demonstrate against corruption, in the largest protests since 2012.
 The protests began in Vladivostok and rolled across the country to Moscow and St Petersburg, which saw the largest crowds.
 The protests were not restricted to Mr Medvedev.
 The protests of five years ago, sparked by rigged parliamentary elections, were largely confined to Moscow and St Petersburg, and deliberately lacked unified leadership; the educated, urbane protesters considered this a sign of political maturity.
 Protests took place in industrial towns in the heartland, such as Nizhny Tagil and Chelyabinsk, and in poorer cities such as Nizhny Novgorod.
 Whereas the protests in 2011-12 had a middle-aged core, the rallies on March 26th were filled with people in their teens and 20s with few memories of their country before Mr Putin.
 With their diverse class backgrounds, the Kremlin cannot portray them as spoiled city hipsters or pitch them against blue-collar workers, as it did with the protesters five years ago.
 Unlike the 30-somethings who took to the streets back then, these younger protesters have little to lose.
 The Kremlin, which successfully suppressed the protests five years ago, has fewer tools at its disposal.
 Another favourite concept, Russia's resurgence to great-power status, is also of limited use: most of the protesters take it for granted.
