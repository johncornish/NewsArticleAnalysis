 Full Text: Chen keeps spending China's HNA Group is on a global shopping spree NOW it is a conglomerate with more than $100bn-worth of assets around the world.
 HNA Group started life as a small local airline.
 Chen Feng, the Chinese company's founder, led a coalition including private investors and the government of Hainan, a southern province, to launch Hainan Airlines in 1993.
 HNA has grown quickly, mainly through acquisitions.
 Some people suspect that these deals chime with China's industrial policy more than HNA's own corporate logic.
 The Hainan government retains a big stake in it, but HNA has traits that distinguish it from state-owned enterprises, which tend to be sclerotic and run by bureaucratic grey men.
 HNA typically does not fire the top brass at firms it acquires, nor does it force big lay-offs.
 HNA is presenting this week's bid for CWT as part of President Xi Jinping's "One Belt, One Road" geopolitical strategy, for example.
 A clampdown on foreign deals by Chinese regulators, who are worried about capital outflows, has led to the cancellation of dozens of announced acquisitions by Chinese firms.
 HNA is having no trouble getting the money and approval to do lots of big deals-it has spent over $40bn on acquisitions in the past three years.
