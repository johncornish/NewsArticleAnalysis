 The 34-year-old Mr Kovac woke up in Austria, where police arrested him in connection with a German financial probe.
 Slovak police and justice officials investigating the kidnapping were frustrated when a key witness went into hiding and his police contact was killed with a car-bomb.
 It pinned the crime on private thugs hired by the Slovak secret services, whose head, Ivan Lexa, was the right-hand man of Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister at the time.
 The senior Mr Kovac was a political opponent of Mr Meciar's.
 Before charges could be brought, Mr Meciar passed an amnesty law that buried the case.
 Mr Meciar has spent the past few years in quiet retirement at his mansion, christened "Elektra".
 Mr Meciar felt obliged to appear on television to defend himself.
 Polls showed that 63% of Slovaks favoured revoking the amnesty law, and on March 13th Robert Fico, the current prime minister, announced that he would do so.
 He may be defending himself against any appearance of complicity; his first government, in 2006, included Mr Meciar's party.
 Any punishment will come too late for the elder Mr Kovac.
