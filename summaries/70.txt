 On July 15th last year, alarmed by reports of an army coup, Mr Unal was injured in a forlorn attempt to block a pair of tanks roaring down an Istanbul avenue.
 "As long as I can remember," he says, "I have been against coups everywhere." The shock of the coup, the bloodiest in Turkey's history, and the courage of thousands of people like Mr Unal who risked their lives to oppose it, has been overshadowed in the world beyond Turkey's borders by the mass purges, detentions and reports of torture that followed it.
 To legitimise President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's draconian policies and to boost his attempt to bolster his powers through a new constitution, the memory and trauma of the coup have been nourished, politicised and consecrated.
 In Mr Erdogan's hands, the coup has turned into the cornerstone of what the president and his supporters refer to as the "New Turkey": a more religious, more anti-Western and less predictable incarnation of the republic founded by Kemal Ataturk over nine decades ago.
 Universities, parks, stadiums, swimming pools and other landmarks across the country, including the Bosporus bridge where soldiers fired on unarmed protesters, have been renamed after the coup and its victims.
 At the start of the school year, children across the country were made to watch a video that moved seamlessly between footage of the coup and images of Ottoman troops squaring off against Allied forces during the first world war.
 Mr Erdogan compares the coup to Turkey's war of independence.
 His aides reach for even more creative historical parallels.
 July 15th was a "Revolution" that will shape Turkey "Just as much as 1789 influenced France and just as the Bolshevik revolution influenced Russia", says Mehmet Ucum, a presidential adviser.
 The coup exposed and brought down the "Antidemocratic structure" within the bureaucracy, Mr Ucum claims.
