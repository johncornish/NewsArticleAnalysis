 Full Text: As Brexit begins, Britain is due for a brutal encounter with reality.
 Theresa May's dispatch of a letter to the European Council on March 29th, invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty, marked the point at which Britain's withdrawal from the union became all but inevitable.
 The task of unwinding Britain's membership of the club is fearsomely complex.
 In Britain, where Brexit increasingly resembles a faith-based initiative, voters have been given wildly unrealistic expectations of the Utopia ahead. Their first contact with the reality of losing preferential access to their main market will be traumatic.
 Unless Mrs May can persuade the Brexiteers on her own side that they must accept concessions, Britain may end up flouncing out of Europe without any deal at all.
 The EU wants to fix the terms of the Article 50 divorce, covering such matters as the rights of citizens resident in other countries and Britain's multi-billion-euro exit bill, before starting work on a future trade deal; Mrs May wants to negotiate on everything at once.
 Mrs May's priority is to fulfil the Leave campaign's promise to "Take back control" by ending the free movement of EU citizens to Britain and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
 Unless Britain accepts these, which implies a role for the system's referee, the ECJ, it cannot operate freely in the single market-as even American firms trading in the EU have found.
 To revert to trading with the EU only on World Trade Organisation terms would cause serious harm to Britain's economy.
 There is a possibility of a deal between Britain and the EU that minimises Brexit's harm.
