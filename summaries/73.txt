 Lost in the row were the millions of refugees who stayed in the developing world, unwilling or unable to journey to richer countries.
 The starting point of "Refuge" by Alexander Betts and Paul Collier, a refugee expert and a development economist, is the plight of the 86% of refugees who live in poor countries.
 Although the number of people displaced by conflict or persecution is at a post-war high of 65m, more salient is the length of their exile: about half the world's refugees have endured their status for more than five years.
 The big argument of "Refuge" is that refugees should be given jobs rather than coddled as victims, and that governments should harness the forces of globalisation and capitalism to help.
 The authors' Eureka moment came in Jordan in 2015, when they were shown a low-tax "Special economic zone" near Zaatari, a refugee camp.
 To test their ideas Messrs Betts and Collier have helped establish a pilot scheme in Jordan, with help from Western governments and companies like Asda, a British supermarket, which uses suppliers that hire refugees in the zone.
 Where does the West fit in? The authors slam Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, for triggering huge movements of refugees and migrants to Europe by relaxing entry rules for Syrians in August 2015.
 Rather than argue for rich countries to take in ever more refugees, the authors urge them to offer political and economic help to "Havens" like Jordan and Kenya, including financial incentives for firms to invest.
 Perhaps a bigger problem is that "Refuge" provides no guide on how to handle today's mixed flows of economic migrants and refugees.
 A few eyebrows will also be raised at the claim that Europe's refugee flows were responsible for Britain's vote to leave the EU. But this should not detract from the humanity of a book that places the long-term needs of the world's refugees at its heart.
