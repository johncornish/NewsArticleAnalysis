 Full Text: A simple device can warn the wearer of noxious substances NERVE agents such as sarin and VX can kill quickly in low doses.
 At the moment, there is no simple way for soldiers in the field, or inspectors looking for manufacturing and storage sites, to detect nerve agents.
 Sarin, VX and their kind are chemicals called organophosphorus compounds, which can be deactivated by an enzyme known as organophosphorus hydrolase.
 Existing nerve-agent detectors record changes induced by the presence of organophosphorus compounds in the electrical resistance of gels impregnated with this enzyme.
 To make their device, he and his colleagues print electrodes made of silver and silver chloride, and of carbon, onto the index fingers of rubber gloves.
 The zone of near-meeting is coated with a layer of gel containing organophosphorus hydrolase.
 The gel connects the ends of the electrodes together, completing the circuit.
 The knuckle-ends of the electrodes are designed to meet a special ring, worn over the glove, that both supplies them with current and transmits information on the strength of that current to a nearby mobile phone-setting off an alarm if the current varies in a way that indicates the enzyme is reacting with a nerve agent.
 To gather a residue sample from a surface, the glove's thumb has a carbon disc printed onto it which the wearer rubs across a suspicious area.
 Tests with organophosphorus compounds smeared on glass, wood, stainless steel and plastic, and also four types of fruit and vegetable, suggest the idea works in principle.
