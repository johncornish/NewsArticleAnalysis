 Full Text: Voters no longer seem to care much about growth PUNDITS and political scientists don't always agree.
 Numerous studies have found a strong correlation between GDP growth and voting behaviour.
 After controlling for other factors, such as the number of parties in an election, a 1% increase in GDP was associated with an increase of nearly three-quarters of a percentage point in support for the incumbent government.
 Fewer voters now identify with particular parties, making elections more volatile.
 Since 2008, incumbent governments have lost on average seven percentage points of support between elections, up from three points in the 1980s.
 You might think that more voters shopping around between parties would increase the importance of objective measures such as economic performance.
 Updating data provided by Ms Dassonneville and Mr Lewis-Beck, The Economist has carried out a cross-country analysis of post-war elections in Western Europe.
 Voters have become deeply hostile towards governing parties, who now lose support regardless of how well the economy is faring.
 Incumbent governments have lost votes between elections in 29 out of 35 elections since 2008.
 If governments think more money in voters' pockets will keep them in power, they are in for a nasty surprise.
