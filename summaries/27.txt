 Full Text: Not going round fast enough The capital's public-transport system is sputtering TRANSANTIAGO, the Chilean capital's public-transport system, had its tenth birthday in February, but no one celebrated.
 Launched with much fanfare, the scheme was supposed to integrate bus and metro lines and speed up traffic.
 Fare evasion is rampant, journeys are getting slower and the state has spent billions of dollars to prop up private bus operators.
 Passengers sometimes wait ages at stops scrawled with graffiti with no inkling of when the next bus will arrive.
 Espacio Publico, a think-tank, calls Transantiago Chile's worst public-policy project since the country returned to democracy in 1990.
 Because bus drivers no longer handle cash, the number of robberies has fallen.
 Planners laid some bus lanes directly over metro lines, so the two forms of transport compete rather than complementing each other.
 The city has hired too few inspectors to catch fare-dodgers and motorists who stray into bus lanes.
 Last month Chile's transport minister resigned, in part to take responsibility for Transantiago's failings.
 The city will have a chance to correct that next year, when contracts to operate bus lines are to expire.
