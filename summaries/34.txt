 Full Text: Faster growth makes China's debt more manageable, but fears linger GUO SHUQING, China's new banking regulator, knows the enormity of his task.
 China's banking system, he observed last month, is worth more than $33trn.
 One investment bank, Morgan Stanley, has declared that China's lenders are "In a sweet spot".
 Another, Goldman Sachs, has upgraded China to "Overweight"-that is, recommending that clients buy Chinese shares-and is especially positive about the banks.
 The clearest positive for China's banks has been an upturn in nominal economic growth.
 Banks took losses on more than 500bn yuan of loans last year, a record, scrubbing them from their books and selling some to investors.
 Overall costs of listed banks rose by just 0.6% last year, even as assets grew by 12%. All these good omens may not mean China's banks have really turned the corner.
 Jason Bedford of UBS, a Swiss bank, says that these companies, which buy delinquent loans from banks, often also finance themselves through bank loans.
 Debt-for-equity swaps are another form of financial engineering: instead of repaying loans, indebted companies can issue shares to third parties, which acquire the loans from banks.
 The upshot is that, whether stashed in bad banks or converted into equity, the debt could yet bounce back into banks' hands.
