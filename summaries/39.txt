 Full Text: The doges would have loved it Covered in barnacles and encrustations, Damien Hirst's new art is exquisitely crafted.
 Despite the story about the shipwreck, these artworks were actually made in Mr Hirst's studios in Britain and by highly trained European craftsmen, and deposited in the Indian Ocean-off Mozambique, it is believed-where they were filmed being lifted out of the sand.
 For a long time Mr Hirst had followed art-market convention, selling his new work discreetly through his main dealers, Jay Jopling and Larry Gagosian, in an arrangement known as the "Primary market".
 Auctions, which are part of the "Secondary market", resell old work rather than fresh work that has never been sold before.
 Collectors who don't need to sell are holding on to their works, and the Hirst auction market has shrunk considerably.
 In 2008, the year of the Sotheby's sale, $223.3m-worth of Hirst work was sold at auction; a year later, with the onset of the financial crisis, volume had slumped to $14.6m. The artist's auction sales in 2016 were lower than in 2009.
 In a rare admission, White Cube, Mr Hirst's London gallery, revealed in 2013 that worldwide sales of his new work the year before had come to $110m.
 Most artists split primary sales equally with their galleries; but Mr Hirst has negotiating power and it is likely he retains more than 50% of any sale, perhaps as much as 75%. The average value of Mr Hirst's auction sales has been relatively consistent since 2009, at just over $17m a year, according to ArtTactic, a specialist research firm.
 If his primary-market sales in 2012 were similarly consistent, then Mr Hirst has been making plenty of money.
 Mr Hirst says the work cost him more than 50m to make, and Mr Pinault has paid several million more to exhibit it.
