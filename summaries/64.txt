 Full Text: Weak electricity demand in China and India is clouding the outlook for coal THE Hazelwood power station in Australia's state of Victoria started generating electricity 52 years ago.
 The stark symbol of an era when coal was king, Hazelwood was one of Australia's dirtiest: its fuel was the Latrobe valley's brown coal, a bigger polluter than the black sort.
 Australia has shut ten coal-fired power stations over the past seven years, yet coal still generates about three-quarters of its electricity.
 The biggest economies besides Japan, which hopes to replace nuclear with "Clean" coal, are either closing down old plants or rethinking plans to build new ones.
 Firstly, electricity demand is stagnant, falling or growing less strongly than expected, which has put considerable financial strain on power plants burning coal.
 As the cost of renewables becomes more competitive with coal, it further blackens its future.
 Coal's first headache, the falling energy intensity of economic growth, is a common feature in the rich world, as economies switch from manufacturing towards services, use more LED lighting and make appliances such as refrigerators and air-conditioners more energy-efficient.
 The same year, China's coal demand plummeted by about 4%. For similar reasons, India's growth in electricity demand, at around 5% a year, lags behind that of GDP as a whole, at about 7%. In both India and China, authorities have overestimated the growth in electricity consumption, procuring coal-fired power that is not used by the grid.
 The result is that coal plants in both countries are operating far below their potential capacity, says Tim Buckley of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an environmental think-tank.
 In the meantime renewable energy prices are falling fast, making the investment case for coal even bleaker.
