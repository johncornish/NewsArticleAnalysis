 Full Text: Out of sight, not out of mind Out of sight, not out of mind Finland shows the way with a project expected to span 100,000 years A STEEP 5km ramp corkscrews down from the mouth of a tunnel into the bowels of the Earth.
 Finland aims to isolate its stockpile in the Onkalo repository, a burial chamber beneath the small forested island of Olkiluoto, home to one of its two nuclear-power plants, for at least 100,000 years.
 In geological terms, that is a heartbeat; Finland's bedrock is 1.9bn years old.
 Posiva's immediate priority is to create disposal caverns far enough from rock fissures and groundwater that Finland's nuclear authorities allow it to start moving the canisters to their tomb in the early 2020s.
 "Finland has a kind of unique institutional context: a high trust in experts and representative democracy," says Matti Kojo, of Finland's Tampere University.
 Finland began the search for a site in 1983, shortly after it began generating nuclear power, and chose Olkiluoto after reviewing 100 areas.
 Whether in crystalline granite, as in Finland and Sweden, or clay, as in France, or volcanic rock, as in Yucca Mountain, nuclear experts are confident that deep geological disposal can be safe.
 Finland's four nuclear reactors operate at among the world's highest utilisation rates, and supply 26% of its electricity.
 Faith in the future Some academics worry that Finland is taking waste disposal too much on faith.
 Finland's model is more closed; it would take a huge amount of digging to recover the waste once it has been sealed.
