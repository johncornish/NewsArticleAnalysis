 Ever since Mr Erdogan took power, the country has been a test of what happens when democracy is put together with political Islam.
 Early in Mr Erdogan's rule, Turkey made great progress towards democracy.
 Sitting in the AK office in Basaksehir, Mustafa Sentop, who helped draft the new constitution, argues that a man of Mr Erdogan's calibre has accomplished things in power despite the system, not because of it.
 In Turkey Mr Erdogan has spent recent years turning them into his fiefs.
 The new constitution allows Mr Erdogan to retain control of his party, giving him power to handpick parliamentary candidates.
 Much of the time, Mr Erdogan has acted under sweeping emergency powers.
 For emergency use Safak Pavey, an opposition MP, argues that Mr Erdogan has weaponised his emergency powers.
 "The law is only being used against us," she says, "Not to provide justice for everyone. Foreign policy has been weaponised, too, perhaps because Mr Erdogan thinks the referendum result is in doubt. After Germany and the Netherlands refused to accept government ministers campaigning for a Yes among Turks in their countries, Mr Erdogan accused them of"Nazi practices".
 Given Mr Erdogan's power today, what difference would victory in the referendum make? Optimists outside Turkey hope that it would inspire him to be conciliatory in an attempt to unite the country.
