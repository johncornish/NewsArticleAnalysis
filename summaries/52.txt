 Contrast that with Ameerpet, a squeezed neighbourhood of Hyderabad that has become India's unofficial cramming-college capital.
 Fees at Ameerpet's informal institutes are typically below 25,000 rupees for classes lasting three to six months.
 The glitziest of Ameerpet's establishments have some of the trappings of MBA programmes: they dish out business cards to students they call "Trainee associates" and help them polish their CVs.

 It is surprising that Ameerpet is as busy as it is.
 Ameerpet will prevail, says Suresh Golla, who runs a popular coaching class there.
