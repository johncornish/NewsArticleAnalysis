 Full Text: Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in office has been a disappointment ASTRONOMICAL downtown rents, power cuts, traffic that gets worse by the week: these are Yangon's growing pains.
 Aung San Suu Kyi, who opposed the generals for decades before assuming the country's leadership last March, entered office with the wind at her back.
 After the landslide victory of Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in elections in late 2015, donors poured in funds and expertise.
 Less than six months after Ms Suu Kyi took office, America lifted long-standing sanctions.
 These incidents point to two frequent complaints about Ms Suu Kyi's government: atrocious communication and a penchant for centralisation.
 "We don't know who to talk to, and we don't know who [Ms Suu Kyi] listens to." There are no regular exchanges between businesses, legislators and regulators, so laws are proposed before MPs understand their impact.
 Many civil-society types complain that they, too, have no access to Ms Suu Kyi's inner circle.
 Even Ms Suu Kyi's main priority, the peace process between the government and the ethnic armies that have fought it for decades, appears to be stalling.
 Ms Suu Kyi is in a tricky position: the army fears she will concede too much to the rebels, while ethnic minorities see her as just another condescending leader from the country's Burman majority, little different from her predecessors.
 Ms Suu Kyi has proved more adept at avoiding them.
