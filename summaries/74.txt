 Full Text: The old Carrie Lam Carrie Lam's education policies will not defuse political tensions in schools THE leader of Hong Kong, Leung Chung-ying, will not be widely missed when he steps down at the end of June, especially by the young.
 Their "Umbrella Movement" was the biggest act of civil disobedience in the territory's history and spawned new groups demanding "Self-determination" for Hong Kong.
 Mrs Lam is widely remembered for her obduracy in a televised debate with student leaders during the Umbrella unrest.
 As chief executive, Mrs Lam will still have no freedom to propose political reform unless China wants it.
 Instead of dwelling on politics, Mrs Lam is trying to show concern for students' welfare.
 Unlike Mr Leung, who supported rigorous testing of students even at a very young age, Mrs Lam talks of a need to "Reduce pressure" on them.
 Mrs Lam wants the testing to be scrapped altogether.
 During her campaign to become chief executive, Mrs Lam promised to increase the annual budget for education by HK$5bn, or nearly 7%, noting that government spending on this was below the average in wealthy economies.
 She is widely expected to replace the unpopular education secretary, Eddie Ng. But Mrs Lam's reforms will do little to ease older students' political frustrations, including their resentment of the Communist Party's insistence on "Patriotism".
 Last month the main advisory body to the parliament in Beijing urged its members from Hong Kong to visit schools in the territory to talk about "National conditions".
