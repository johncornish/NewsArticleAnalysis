 Full Text: Investors don't always like democracy THE VICTORY of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, in a referendum on April 16th is seen by many observers as a worrying step on the road to autocracy.
 Like an errant husband, investors may proclaim their fidelity to democracy but are not averse to seeing someone else on the side.
 In Turkey investors may have feared turmoil if Mr Erdogan's proposal had been defeated.
 The early years of Mr Erdogan's tenure, when he was seen as a liberalising democrat, saw rapid economic growth; his transformation into an emerging autocrat has not put investors off.
 Go back in time 100 years and investors would have been pretty suspicious of democratic governments.
 Democracies can enact policies that are not market-friendly; the interests of ordinary voters and international investors are not always aligned.
 In many countries, investors could be relatively relaxed about which party took office; economic reforms were pushed through by Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schroder and Tony Blair, all politicians from the centre-left.
 Democracies work best when there is a modicum of consensus and voters are willing to accept defeat for their own side as legitimate.
 The general drift is towards more authoritarian, more nationalistic policies that appeal to voters whose living standards have stagnated.
 Investors may believe that some of these authoritarian leaders will deliver policies they like in the short run-tax cuts, for example.
