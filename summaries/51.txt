 If you are a bird, it has an extra question, not asked so forcefully of animals that cannot fly: "Is that extra gram of weight really necessary?" Contrary to the insult "Bird-brained", birds are not notably more stupid than mammals, but the pressure to keep organs light applies to the cerebrum as much as it does to anything else.
 For the past century birds have faced a new enemy that might require them to get smarter: the motor car.
 These days, cars and other motorised vehicles kill around 250m birds a year.
 The conclusion of this syllogism is that small-brained birds are more likely to be road-kill than large-brained birds are.
 To test this idea he needed data on a lot of dead birds.
 These details include the weights of the internal organs, and likely cause of death, of 3,521 bird specimens of 251 species.
 This time, they asked whether there was a difference between the weights of the organs of birds killed by traffic and of those that had died of other causes.
 The smaller a bird's brain, when controlled for its body size, the more likely it was to have been road-kill.
 Some 60% of the smallest-brained birds Mr Erritzoe handled had died this way.
 All this suggests a selective pressure on birds in parts of the world with lots of traffic to acquire bigger brains, even at the cost of the extra energy required to keep those brains airborne.
