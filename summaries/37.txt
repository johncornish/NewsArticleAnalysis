 Having pillaged shallower waters, the world's fishing powers are looking to the mesopelagic as a new frontier.
 In September the government of Sindh, a province that is home to most of Pakistan's fishing fleet, issued a draft policy on licensing mesopelagic fishing in its waters.
 At the North Atlantic Seafood Forum, held in March, in Bergen, Norway's principal port, the session about fishing the mesopelagic was entitled "The Big Apple".
 Deep waters To try to understand the mesopelagic better, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts, NASA, America's space agency, and Norway's Institute of Marine Research are all embarking on projects to study it.
 Without mesopelagic predators, far more plankton would die in the surface waters, their bodily carbon returned rapidly to the atmosphere.
 Norway, which has long paid attention to the sustainability of its fishing operations, will launch the third incarnation of Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the flagship of its marine-research fleet, in May, with an explicit focus on mapping and understanding mesopelagic life using the most advanced civilian sonar available.
 One of WHOI's research vessels will tow Deep See through the mesopelagic, gathering wide-angle camera footage and environmental data.
 WHOI's third type of mesopelagic robot will be disposable probes called Snowclops.
 In collaboration with NASA, WHOI also hopes to find variables that are observable by satellite and that correlate with the health of the mesopelagic and the size of its carbon flux.
 The forthcoming decade should serve to start answering the question of how much fishing of the mesopelagic can be undertaken without disrupting it-and with it, its role in climate regulation.
