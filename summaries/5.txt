 Full Text: An all-American product finds new takers EARLY spring is the main selling season for recreational vehicles and the phone on Tom Troiano's desk has been ringing incessantly.
 The owner of Continental RV, a dealership in Farmingdale, a village on Long Island, Mr Troiano is on track to sell more RVs this year than in any other since the early 2000s.
 RVs are a quintessentially American invention: more than two-thirds are made in the United States.
 Nationally, sales surged to 430,000 units last year, a 40-year high.
 During the 2008-09 recession, notes Mr Troiano, RV dealerships everywhere closed down, leaving his shop among the very few left serving the New York metropolitan area.
 A decade ago the average age of an RV-owner was 49, and over 90% were white, says Kevin Broom of the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, an industry body.
 Anecdotal reports suggest that ethnic minorities now make up around a sixth of all new customers, says Mr Broom.
 The industry hopes that its poor record with foreign sales-last year less than 1% of RVs produced domestically were shipped to foreign markets-may improve, too.
 The country imported 1,000 vehicles last year, over half of them American.
 RV manufacturers are also marketing the notion that their motor homes can be commercial as well as leisure vehicles.
