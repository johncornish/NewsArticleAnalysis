 Existing users are certainly consuming more of its strongest, crystalline form, known locally as "Ice".
 Most ice comes from China where a thriving pharmaceutical industry underpins its production, according to John Coyne, a former intelligence official.
 Organised drug rings are attracted to Australia, where the street value of ice is over six times that in China.
 Huge trade flows between the two countries make it relatively easy to import the drug and repatriate the profits.
 For around A$40, a hit of ice can last over half a day.
 Theoretically it still does: following the recommendations of a National Ice Task Force, it allocated A$300m to reduce demand and help addicts last year.
 Consumers are more likely to be arrested than dealers, and police put more effort into seizing drugs than into unravelling the rings that smuggle them, Mr Coyne argues.
 Huge increases in arrests and seizures have had no lasting effect on the supply or price of ice.
 "It's like sticking your finger in a bucket of water." Unfortunately, politicians find it increasingly hard to peddle "Soft" responses to a drug considered the cause of much violence.
