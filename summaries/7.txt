 Mrs May says the election is necessary to protect the Brexit process from mischievous opposition parties that plan to derail it.
 Elections are inherently hard to predict-this one could be treated by voters as a poll about everything from the railways to the National Health Service.
 With Mr Corbyn clinging on and the economy yet to feel the smack of Brexit, Mrs May has a chance to increase her working majority of 17 to perhaps more than 100.
 For the 48% of voters who, like this newspaper, opposed Brexit, this may look ominous.
 Although Mrs May has sometimes threatened to leave without any agreement, saying "No deal is better than a bad deal", she has lately accepted the need for a transition arrangement after Brexit.
 In Parliament the election will end the odd situation in which MPs have been bound both by the wishes of their constituents in the previous election and also by the referendum.
 The next parliament's MPs will have a mandate to stand up for whatever they advocate on the stump, be it hard Brexit, soft Brexit or complete Breversal.
 Tories fighting seats in Remain-voting areas such as London and the university towns may have to soften their line on Brexit if they are to avoid a similar fate.
 Since the referendum those advocating a soft Brexit have been shouted down as anti-democratic.
 Businesses, lobby groups and, of course, private citizens have a chance to make the case for a soft Brexit both during the campaign and after it, during the long months of negotiation to follow.
