 Since 2000 the annual tally of students graduating from university has increased nearly eightfold, to more than 7.5m. But many rural students are neglected by China's school system, and they are not the only ones.
 Too, are the children of migrants who have moved to the cities from the countryside and poor students who want to go to senior high school.
 The government has not been completely blind to the need to ensure that rural people have enough schooling to work in factories, but it has shown little sense of urgency.
 Since the population of young people in the countryside is falling so smaller schools are closing.
 Conditions at these boarding schools are often appalling.
 So poor is their nutrition that they are often shorter than their counterparts at day schools.
 Everyone in China has to attend school for nine years-until the end of junior high school.
 Like city dwellers, they still have to pay for senior high school.
 Their children are often barred from state-funded urban schools.
 The central government must also do more to ensure that rural schools have enough money to teach and feed their pupils-basic education is too important to be left to ill-motivated local authorities.
