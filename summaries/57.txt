 Full Text: The world has made amazing progress in eradicating extreme poverty.
 Since then the number of people in absolute poverty has fallen by about 1bn and the number of non-poor people has gone up by roughly 4bn. By 2013, the most recent year for which reliable data exist, just 10.7% of the world's population was poor.
 Poverty has almost certainly retreated further since 2013: the World Bank's finger-in-the-wind estimate for 2016 is 9.1%. Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, calculates that someone escapes extreme poverty every 1.2 seconds.
 The share of people living in absolute poverty will almost certainly not decline as quickly in the future-and not because it will hit zero and therefore have nowhere to fall.
 Even as the global proportion of poor people continues to drift slowly downwards, large pockets of poverty will persist, and some of them are likely to swell.
 In 1987 China is thought to have had 660m poor people, and India 374m. The concentration of destitution in those two countries was in one sense a boon, because in both places better economic policies allowed legions to scramble out of poverty.
 Because Africa's population is growing so quickly-by about 2.5% a year, compared with 1% for Asia-and because the poverty rate is declining only slowly, the number of poor Africans is higher than it was in the 1990s.
 With huge numbers of people who are barely out of poverty, it now needs to prevent near-paupers from falling back, while also dragging the poorest out of destitution faster than economic growth alone could do the job.
 The world is now supposed to cut the absolute poverty rate to 9% by 2020 and 3% by 2030.
 Still, a global target for reducing absolute poverty seems increasingly beside the point, because poverty is less and less global.
