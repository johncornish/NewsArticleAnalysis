 Last year no party campaigned to remain in the European Union so vehemently.
 The party's noisy opposition to the government's proposed "Hard Brexit" has helped it to notch up some spectacular swings in council and parliamentary elections since the referendum.
 Lib Dem watchers guess the party could pick up more than 20 new seats.
 Nick Clegg, a former party leader and deputy prime minister, has confirmed he will stand again.
 The party's position on Brexit has also helped it to win back protest voters, who abandoned the party when it got into bed with the Conservatives in 2010.
 According to a recent poll by Opinium, only a third of voters now think that the party was wrong to have entered into coalition with the Tories.
 Its appeal seems to go beyond Europhiles: since the referendum the party has picked up more council seats in Leave-voting areas than Remain ones.
 The party's profile will rise during the campaign; the fact that it is the most strident anti-Brexit party will attract television cameras, says Mr Ford.
 Even if the party's national polling does not pick up, it will pour resources into marginal seats, while other parties will have to campaign across the country.
 The party claims that its membership has doubled since the 2015 general election, to more than 90,000.
