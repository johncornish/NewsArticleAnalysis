 Full Text: The quickest way to break the ice is by submarine ARCTIC sea-ice is melting.
 The ice is still not melting fast enough.
 Some people think this approach-bludgeoning through the ice with what is, in essence, an armour-plated knife-is old-fashioned.
 For things like freeing river mouths of ice, this approach can work well.
 Hovercraft skirts are easily damaged by ridged ice, so the vehicles cannot be used in places that require frequent clearance.
 Dr Kozin's original research was on ways to permit naval submarines to surface safely and quickly through ice, the previous method having been simply to rise until contact was made with the ice sheet and then increase buoyancy until the ice cracked.
 Dr Kozin found that the bow wave from a submarine travelling close to the surface pushes the ice sheet upwards, making flexural gravity waves in it, which cause it to break up.
 Follow-up studies by Dr Kozin and his pupil, Vitaliy Zemlyak, who is now at the Sholem-Aleichem Priamursky State University in Birobidzhan, indicate that a submarine travelling 30 metres below the ice can break a sheet one metre thick.
 Comparable data are not available for Arktika, but America's heavy icebreaker, Polar Star, can break a channel through two-metre ice at a rate of three knots.
 Dr Kozin and Dr Zemlyak have also found that the area of ice broken can be increased greatly by using two submarines moving together on parallel courses, and they are now looking at increasing the pressure exerted on the ice still further, by adding wedges, spoilers and vortex generators to a submarine, or even installing an impeller, a giant propeller mounted horizontally.
