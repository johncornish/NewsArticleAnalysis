 Full Text: The nominee to run the Food and Drug Administration is a sound pick WHEN the names of potential candidates for the new head of America's regulatory agency for drugs, the Food and Drug Administration, were first circulated, you could almost hear the sound of jaws hitting desks throughout the pharmaceuticals industry.
 The idea of not approving drugs for efficacy is as unwelcome to the industry as it is to doctors and patients.
 It spends billions of dollars every year on research to deliver better treatments; this would be impossible to justify if drugs had merely to be safe.
 Mr Gottlieb will certainly wish to find more ways of speeding drug approvals.
 In some cases it is clear that the demand for ever-larger clinical trials of new drugs has done little for safety, raised costs and rewarded chiefly the very largest companies that can afford to run them.
 GlaxoSmithKline, a British pharmaceutical group, recently completed the world's first such test for a drug, Relvar, which treats asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Generic drugs is another area where Mr Gottlieb has signalled his views.
 He may want to tackle the rising cost and complexity of filing applications to market generic drugs-the problem that allowed Martin Shkreli, a controversial entrepreneur, to raise the price of Daraprim, an anti-parasitic drug, by 5,000% in 2015, causing fury.
 Sudip Parikh, a policy adviser at the Drug Information Association, another think-tank, says the rate of change means that decades-old rules and regulations may not function well for new treatments.
 The FDA is a complicated agency of 17,000 staff and Mr Gottlieb may have little financial room for manoeuvre: under Donald Trump and a Republican Congress, the hope of more funds is slim.
