 Full Text: A lime-green fiasco The government's counter-terrorism campaign has a long way to go FOR four days all eyes in Bangladesh were on Atia Mahal, a lime-green, five-floor apartment block in the north-eastern city of Sylhet.
 The police cordoned off the building on March 24th after receiving word that a group of Islamic militants had holed up in one of its flats.
 It was the first indiscriminate suicide-attack on civilians in Bangladesh.
 Islamic State, the jihadist group that runs a dwindling portion of Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attack, its 28th in Bangladesh since 2015.
 The government insists-to near-universal disbelief-that the perpetrators are a new faction of a home-grown group called Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh.
 Its appeasement of extreme religious groups such as Hefazat-e-Islam, which share much of the militants' worldview, is at odds with the crackdown.
 Bangladesh's neighbour, India, will also be worried.
 This month its Border Security Force warned that more than 3,000 militants had entered India across its border with Bangladesh, the world's fifth-longest.
 India has three main security concerns: that Bangladesh is a haven for various insurgent groups fighting the Indian government; that large numbers of illegal migrants from Bangladesh are changing the ethnic and religious character of the border areas; and that Bangladesh is turning away from its long history of secularism and tolerance.
 Sheikh Hasina has tried to suppress the insurgents using Bangladesh as a base for operations in India, with some success.
