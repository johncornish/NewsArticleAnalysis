 99% of adults are now enrolled in Aadhaar, a scheme which has amassed the fingerprints and iris scans of over 1.1bn people since 2010.
 Ghosts v the machine Linking ration cards to an Aadhaar number, and thus to the biometric data tied to it, means a single person cannot have more than one and ghosts can have none.
 The original pitch to politicians-the scheme was adopted by the previous government, but has been embraced by Narendra Modi, the prime minister-was that Aadhaar would help make welfare more efficient.
 Over 400,000 ghost children were struck off school rolls in just three states after schools were required to match their pupils to Aadhaar numbers to keep receiving state funds.
 A project to purge electoral lists found 800,000 fictitious voters in Punjab, a state of 30m. The authorities suspect that 30% of driving licences are fake, many of them duplicates to help drivers evade bans-a ruse that would be impossible if all licences were linked to Aadhaar.
 The improvements in accuracy and efficiency are so enormous that the government now wants to use Aadhaar more broadly than originally advertised.
 If implemented, these new uses would put paid to the notion that enrolling in Aadhaar is voluntary, which was the promise of its backers-led by Nandan Nilekani, an IT grandee who used to chair the agency that set up Aadhaar.
 Aadhaar is a poor way to build up an Orwellian panopticon, Mr Nilekani argues, given the wealth of information already available from telephone records, GPS data, bank statements and the like.
 Unlike reading an ID card, checking someone's identity through Aadhaar requires an internet connection and, often, electricity.
 Already the Aadhaar database is being tapped 20m times a day, 20 times the rate of a year and a half ago.
