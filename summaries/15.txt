 Even before all of the ballots had been counted, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's president, stepped in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul and proclaimed victory.
 "April 16th was a victory for all of Turkey." Yet it was hardly the win Mr Erdogan had expected.
 After fresh elections in 2019, Mr Erdogan will rule uncontested, appointing senior officials, judges and members of his own cabinet, with little oversight by an expanded but weakened parliament.
 Mr Erdogan asked foreign observers to keep their concerns to themselves.
 His prime minister added: "The people's decision is clear and the result is a Yes." The allegations will haunt Mr Erdogan for years, leaving the country even more polarised than before.
 Mr Erdogan might be "The most unassailable Turkish leader since Ataturk but this legitimacy issue will hang over his head," says Soner Cagaptay, a fellow at the Washington Institute.
 Other than Donald Trump's America, which joined model democracies such as Russia, Sudan, Hungary and Djibouti in congratulating Mr Erdogan, no leader of a big Western country has welcomed the vote.
 Mr Erdogan did not appear particularly keen to rebuild bridges with Europe: on the day of the vote, he pledged once again to do his part to reinstate the death penalty, which would threaten the membership of Turkey in the Council of Europe and torpedo its already comatose accession talks with the EU. One-man show Supporters of the new constitution say it will improve decision-making by concentrating power in Mr Erdogan's hands, precluding unwieldy political coalitions and neutralising powerful unelected officials.
 Mr Erdogan is expected formally to rejoin AK as soon as official results are announced this week.
 Mr Erdogan's initial comments suggest he will disregard the slim margin of victory and portray the referendum as a sign of support for his crackdown.
