 Take the case of Egor Putilov, also known as Alexander Fridback, Tobias Lagerfeldt and Aleksandr Yarovenko.
 On June 8th 2016, Sveriges Radio, the Swedish public radio station, interviewed Mr Putilov, who identified himself as a former employee of the national migration agency.
 It found, the so-called Mr Putilov was in fact Alexander Fridback, an employee of the ultra-nationalist Sweden Democrats party.
 Mr Fridback immigrated to Sweden from Russia in 2007, apparently under the name Aleksandr Yarovenko.
 In 2011 he changed his family name to Fridback, supposedly because Swedes found Yarovenko hard to pronounce.
 In 2015 Mr Fridback wrote an opinion piece in Aftonbladet alleging that Islamic State could use the migrant crisis to infiltrate Sweden.
 Within hours, his article was picked up by Sputnik, the Russian state-controlled news agency.
 Most damningly, Sveriges Radio discovered that in 2014 Mr Fridback had bought a house in Sweden at a below-market price from a Russian criminal who was, at the time, in prison in Russia.
 No one was sure what it all meant, and Mr Fridback denies any shady connections or wrongdoing.
 Because of his exposure to Russia, security experts termed Mr Fridback a security risk, the government demanded explanations, and he ultimately left his job with the Sweden Democrats.
