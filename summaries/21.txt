 Full Text: To understand the trade-offs that Brexit Britain must make, look to EFTA NORWAY offers much to envy.
 Members of EFTA have dozens of deals, including two with China, with which the EU cannot even start negotiations.
 EFTA's half-in-half-out relationship with the EU hinders its trade as much as it helps.
 EFTA's flexibility in trade stems from its odd relationship with the EU. Switzerland has a series of bilateral agreements, whereas Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are part of the single market through the European Economic Area.
 A recent paper from the European Parliament found that EFTA tends to make trade deals faster than the EU. South Korea's talks with EFTA took half as long as those with the EU. EFTA is speedy because it can agree on a common strategy faster than the EU, which has more countries to accommodate.
 The parliament paper also notes that EFTA's agreements have been "Shallow" compared with the EU's.
 EFTA is not a big market: its partners are happy to make deals, but they are loth to spend too much time on the finer details.
 The relatively low quality of the deals helps explain why EFTA's free-trade agreements still account for only about a tenth of its members' trade.
 Britain is a much bigger market than EFTA. But it will still be in a far weaker negotiating position outside the EU than as part of the single market.
 Goods moving from EFTA to an EU member undergo "Rules of origin" checks, to ensure that the exporter is not avoiding EU tariffs.
